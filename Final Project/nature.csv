A beautiful river and man the murderer,"
Today i pass through the rugged land
looks like a dying labourer's wretched hand
Where once huge trees grew
innumerable stumps stand
like burnt matchsticks
stuck in the sand
At the long dry trench i stare
A beautiful river once flowed here
In a passing truck corpses of trees squeal
The selfish murderer in man they reveal

"
A Bunch of Roses,"
Roses ruddy and roses white,
What are the joys that my heart discloses?
Sitting alone in the fading light
Memories come to me here tonight
With the wonderful scent of the big red roses.
Memories come as the daylight fades
Down on the hearth where the firelight dozes;
Flicker and flutter the lights and shades,
And I see the face of a queen of maids
Whose memory comes with the scent of roses.
Visions arise of a scent of mirth,
And a ball-room belle who superbly poses --
A queenly woman of queenly worth,
And I am the happiest man on earth
With a single flower from a bunch of roses.
Only her memory lives tonight --
God in his wisdom her young life closes;
Over her grave may the turf be light,
Cover her coffin with roses white
She was always fond of the big white roses.
*
Such are the visions that fade away --
Man proposes and God disposes;
Look in the glass and I see today
Only an old man, worn and grey,
Bending his head to a bunch of roses."
"A child said, What is the grass","
A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full
	hands;
How could I answer the child?. . . .I do not know what it
	is any more than he.
I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful
	green stuff woven.
Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,
A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,
Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we
	may see and remark, and say Whose?
Or I guess the grass is itself a child. . . .the produced babe
	of the vegetation.
Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow
	zones,
Growing among black folks as among white,
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the
same, I receive them the same.
And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.
Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
It may be if I had known them I would have loved them;
It may be you are from old people and from women, and
	from offspring taken soon out of their mother's laps,
And here you are the mother's laps.
This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old
	mothers,
Darker than the colorless beards of old men,
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.
O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths
	for nothing.
I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men
	and women,
And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring
	taken soon out of their laps.
What do you think has become of the young and old men?
What do you think has become of the women and
	children?
They are alive and well somewhere;
The smallest sprouts show there is really no death,
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait
	at the end to arrest it,
And ceased the moment life appeared.
All goes onward and outward. . . .and nothing collapses,
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and
	luckier."
A Coloured Print by Shokei,"
It winds along the face of a cliff
This path which I long to explore,
And over it dashes a waterfall,
And the air is full of the roar
And the thunderous voice of waters which sweep
In a silver torrent over some steep.
It clears the path with a mighty bound
And tumbles below and away,
And the trees and the bushes which grow in the rocks
Are wet with its jewelled spray;
The air is misty and heavy with sound,
And small, wet wildflowers star the ground.
Oh! The dampness is very good to smell,
And the path is soft to tread,
And beyond the fall it winds up and on,
While little streamlets thread
Their own meandering way down the hill
Each singing its own little song, until
I forget that 't is only a pictured path,
And I hear the water and wind,
And look through the mist, and strain my eyes
To see what there is behind;
For it must lead to a happy land,
This little path by a waterfall spanned."
A Friend In Nature,"
I've found a friend in nature
although nature could turn on me
if i'm out and about in a storm
and its lightning strikes me
if a tidal wave sweeps me far out to sea
or a poisonous snake takes a bite of me
if a tornado twirls me high into the sky
yes, the irony is that nature which
i find so enchanting
could one day cause my demise "
A Letter To A  Green Leaf,"
Dear Leaf,
Up in the tree, what were you waving at?
Of course you were hiding birds, you let
The red ant stumble upon you with his prized dead bee.
And you held the breeze twirling
in your lifeline, and blushed in the evening rain.
All that you did well. You took a longing look
Wondering if the sun
Would keep loving you until the end of time. I know you
Did that, you had your problems and doubts
If love would after all be true until then.
And so today when I walked beneath you,
I did not  care that
you had turned red so soon.
And that you were waiting, waiting for me
To come by.  There is
no disgrace dear,
Losing to the sun, the wind and rain,
the last raiment of your breath
We all do, we always do. Like you thought
If you broke away from the tree
You could fly away.
A new life breathless in the long arms of the river
and that there would be love again there.
Or upon the stone,
and its hard caress . But then like the others,
love simmered in the distance,
and as you leaned out to touch,
 you fell.

"
A Poem about Nature,"
As a child I was taught poems about nature.
I didn't really know what that meant.
Nature was the park at the end of the street
Where you weren't allowed to walk on the grass
And bushes and trees were trimmed and civilised.
In the park I was allowed to run
If I was careful not to bump into someone.
I was allowed to talk and sing,
But not shout.
Nature was a closed-off park.
At school,
I dutifully learned by heart
That nature was beautiful.
I watched the leaves in the park
Turning to so-called gold
And falling off.
That was poetry.
I lost interest
For the next thirty years.
Then I wrote a poem
About a building in a grey street
With rows of identical windows
And television antennas.
I had freed myself from nature.
Now at the bottom of my street
There is another park.
Childen and dogs roll around on the grass.
The air smells of pine.
Bushes, trees and flowers run wild.
No one tells you to be quiet.
I sit there
And listen
And write."
A Sylvan Scene,"
I shall not go thither,
Here are oaks, here is the galingale,
Here bees hum sweetly around their hives;
Here are two springs of coolest water,
Here birds warble on the trees,
Nor is there any shade
Equal to that beside thee,
And the pine showers its cones from on high."
a walk in the forest,"
the forest takes one
for a quiet walk in the morning;
of oneself
and the solitude and the path and the trees
and the air and the stillness and the undefined sunlight;
a moment of lightness, an instant of calm;
did one come from the walk?

"
A Winter Wish,"
OLD wine to drink!
    Ay, give the slippery juice
That drippeth from the grape thrown loose
    Within the tun;
Plucked from beneath the cliff
Of sunny-sided Teneriffe,
  And ripened 'neath the blink
    Of India's sun!
    Peat whiskey hot,
Tempered with well-boiled water!
These make the long night shorter,
    Forgetting not
Good stout old English porter.   
  Old wood to burn!
Ay, bring the hillside beech
From where the owlets meet and screech,
    And ravens croak;
The crackling pine, and cedar sweet;
Bring too a clump of fragrant peat,
  Dug 'neath the fern;
    The knotted oak,
    A fagot too, perhap,
Whose bright flame, dancing, winking,
Shall light us at our drinking;
    While the oozing sap
Shall make sweet music to our thinking.   
  Old books to read!
Ay, bring those nodes of wit,
The brazen-clasped, the vellum writ,
    Time-honored tomes!
The same my sire scanned before,
The same my grandsire thumbèd o'er,
The same his sire from college bore,
  The well-earned meed
    Of Oxford's domes:
    Old Homer blind,
Old Horace, rake Anacreon, by
Old Tully, Plautus, Terence lie;
Mort Arthur's olden minstrelsie,
Quaint Burton, quainter Spenser, ay!
And Gervase Markham's venerie—
    Nor leave behind
The holye Book by which we live and die.   
  Old friends to talk!
Ay, bring those chosen few,
The wise, the courtly, and the true,
    So rarely found;
Him for my wine, him for my stud,
Him for my easel, distich, bud
  In mountain walk!
    Bring Walter good,
With soulful Fred, and learned Will,
And thee, my alter ego (dearer still
    For every mood).
These add a bouquet to my wine!
These add a sparkle to my pine!
    If these I tine,
Can books, or fire, or wine be good? "
Afoot In The Snow,"
Pale moon shadows fall upon the lone rusted lantern and pole
In the snow where do these sole footprints go?
Looking lonely in the lantern’s yellow glow
Who lit this light in such a night?
I follow them, syncopated in time
Now they seem to pace steadier, faster, with no reason or rhyme
The whiteness is cold, and at the same time charming
Its existence is beautiful, quiet and disarming
The footprints move by the old wooden fence
My sense of aloneness brings me a warmth and pleasance
The footprints head towards old Carter’s well
So I march on for this mystery to quell
Snow under my feet crunches and chimes
Bricks and roof have toppled with time
I wonder to myself of a time distant past
When this well was alive and down the bucket was cast
The footprints stop here, at the well and trees
They do not continue on as far as I can see
Searching for more ‘round winter’s trees branches bare
That hide springtime’s hidden flora, fauna and flair
And now I wonder how I was led
Down this path in this peaceful stead
There is nobody to be seen, anywhere, no voice
I have no choice
To move along, to go, afoot in the snow

"
An Asphodel,"
O dear sweet rosy
unattainable desire
...how sad, no way
to change the mad
cultivated asphodel, the
visible reality...
and skin's appalling
petals--how inspired
to be so Iying in the living
room drunk naked
and dreaming, in the absence
of electricity...
over and over eating the low root
of the asphodel,
gray fate...
rolling in generation
on the flowery couch
as on a bank in Arden--
my only rose tonite's the treat
of my own nudity.
Fall, 1953"
An Evident Soul,"
I am not confound and confused,
Like any arguing philosopher,
Or calculating mathematician,
For I can observe with vivid vision,
An evident soul hiding, concealing,
In layers of the colours, and fragrance,
Enveloping the whole scheme,
Manifesting in countless forms,
But living behind in unique singularity.

As Through the Wild Green Hills of Wyre,"
As through the wild green hills of Wyre
The train ran, changing sky and shire,
And far behind, a fading crest,
Low in the forsaken west
Sank the high-reared head of Clee,
My hand lay empty on my knee.
Aching on my knee it lay:
That morning half a shire away
So many an honest fellow's fist
Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist.
Hand, said I, since now we part
From fields and men we know by heart,
For strangers' faces, strangers' lands,--
Hand, you have held true fellows' hands.
Be clean then; rot before you do
A thing they'll not believe of you.
You and I must keep from shame
In London streets the Shropshire name;
On banks of Thames they must not say
Severn breeds worse men than they;
And friends abroad must bear in mind
Friends at home they leave behind.
Oh, I shall be stiff and cold
When I forget you, hearts of gold;
The land where I shall mind you not
Is the land where all's forgot.
And if my foot returns no more
To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore,
Luck, my lads, be with you still
By falling stream and standing hill,
By chiming tower and whispering tree,
Men that made a man of me.
About your work in town and farm
Still you'll keep my head from harm,
Still you'll help me, hands that gave
A grasp to friend me to the grave."
At Katibawasan,"
It is not true
that all things
are born
in warmth.
A strong stem
of white water
plunges into
a corner of
the emerald pool.
My arms are
outstretched
pale greeen
beneath
the water.
Swallows crush
their wings
against
the water's surface.
And I am in the
grip
of some
nameless ecstasy,
emerging from
water
cold
as ice.

"
August,"
Alone in the deep August
must have to find the spirit
secluding from the narrow pathways
to a tiny heart as a guest
just below where the sky
turns saffron in the evening
a song perched too or a flight
on the winds not knowing  why
a stout tree with branches
no longer than the span of an overlooking
its leaves a little fuchsia, a little tangerine
almost dropping for the chances
when must an eager climb
learn the soft spots and hard cores
like a leaf to waft away
and the passing wind chime
we move as the gentle waves
return to oneself
counting the figures on the lines
on our hands.

"
Aumakua Rant,"
I was running up the mountain,
Just dog tired,
Suffering,
My mind drifting
Between the Infinite Rift.
My Aumakua (spirit animal) stops on a branch nearby.
He starts to chirp a mile a minute.
I cannot understand him.
For a second I imagine his chirps as something other than sounds.
This is what the little bird might have said,
""If Friends come and go
Enemies must
Stay and stop
Or what happens
If I don't think?
Does that mean
I am not?
Could I just fizzle away
into the immaterial matter in the air?
Become one with the universe,
Dissipate like the wind
Which has a pulse and a spirit
And a really bad temper.
The wind gets really pissed
If you break its rules.
For every reaction
There is a bell that goes off in a parallel universe
And two porcupines make love very carefully
Until one of them pokes the other
In the way that poking is bad...""
I put my finger in my ear, and realize the bird is still chirping and chattering, But for some reason I can't understand him any more. Maybe I never could.

"
Autumn Leaves,"
Why, in autumn, do leaves await the morning time?
Is there a requirement that the Rooster crow to announce the event?
Or does the bustle on the forest floor,
Where the deer and rabbit find their way,
Need to prepare somehow.
 Just like we may do, for a holiday?
 Trotting softly amongst the trees,
The ground lies bare beneath my steed.
The pace is slowed on well-trodden trails.
Except for the occasional broken bark or limb,
Lying listless upon the sandy loam.
Leaves of rustling crimson loom over head,
Their soft shadows filter the fading daylight.
They are in obvious accord with one another.
 It’s not their time to let go.
Ominously through the light evening breezes,
 The bristling leaves bear the increasing seizes
Of tiny droplets upon their fragile stems so tall.
 Under the moonlight they strain
 Against the Omni-potent pull of Sir Isaac Newton’s law.
As dawn rises thru the light morning mist,
Sun beams deliver their radiance and warmth,
And caress autumn leaves with a gentle kiss.
A sparkle of essence awakens nearest,
The prize is quickly grasped by rested drops of dew,
And not knowing what to do,
 Soon expire to the atmosphere,
 From which they are derived,
And take their place amongst the cirrus.
Now released from their burden,
 The leaves stretch upward without effort,
 In artful defiance of the naked woodland floor.
The moment has arrived, the waiting is no more!
They lift up as if to sigh, and pay homage to the sky.
And with their final resolve determined,
 In that moment, without resistance,
They simply let go, as if to die.
Anticipating the inevitable precipitous fall,
They have conspired a gracious ballet!
A spectacular display of cascading, swirling dance,
With Rhythmic fantasies orchestrated by Calais!
A grand finale amongst grasshoppers and ants.
A graceful display of crimson, silver, saffron and gold,
 Impressing even the Rajahs of Old! 
  But then, at what would appear the end of their journey,
 A surprise!
Euros’ Cool breezes quickly lend a hand and create a new sight.
Rising up again, as if by chance, an aerobatic pretension of flight!
 This humors the sparrows and butterflies alike.
But alas, a pre-determined descent nonetheless brief,
As the passing formation of honking snow geese.
A descent on the lightest and most fickle of winds,
That passes by way of tree tops and limbs,
And then with a curtsey and final swirl to the ground.
To greet earth worms and grubs
That crawls amongst the darkest surrounds.
Heaping upon the fertile compost,
 In soft supple Piles,
Stirred by the wind,
Resolved by the rain,
 Soon to be dirt.
 The worms create their mounds.
 They make their contribution to Life’s endless ballet.
  One in which we all participate,
 Some willing and some not so willing,
 As such is the way.
This much we share In common.
Gold and crimson autumn leaves,
like snowflakes  fall.
And so must we all.

"
Beloved Ireland,"
How far your dreams are walking
While masters whisper out for them,
I wonder while watching
The blueish shadows in awe,
Twirling around you, beloved Ireland,
As if you were a slender young candle;
(Wise men say that shadows are fellow sufferers and travellers to our dreams)
How far your dreams are walking
While masters whisper out for them,
I wonder while the wind reaches out through the quiet fog,
The wind that softly caresses your beautiful face,
Beloved Ireland,
The world never looked as beautiful
As it does this morning,
When my gaze met your gaze,
Beloved country,
The valleys were set ablaze in a lush
And moist green,
As if the most beautiful woman's eyes are flaming in the dreamlit air,
I sense the scent of your wonderful body,
Like the scent of that slender fir,
Atop the highest mountain,
Allured by the moon at night.
I didn't hear a thing... not a thing...
Apart from the unbridled and loud beating of my own heart,
And you, my beloved Ireland,
You blissfully laugh,
Inadvertently grabbing my heart.
Beloved Ireland, intertwined with roads of dreams,
Now my dreams,
Rising from copper chains towards the golden sun,
Are mingling with the old hero's dreams,
Who solitary buries his mute, salty tears
Into your sacred bosom,
Like the seed of a new life.
I am praising you, my beloved Ireland!
If I could choose where I shall be buried,
I would like my grave to be there.
If I had to wake up lonely in the world,
I would like to wake up there,
In the crystal night's embrace,
In the proud wind's embrace,
In your embrace,
Beloved Ireland!"
Beyond Us,"
Leaning down on its roots, the stem
I see of a wounded tree.
Seven coated lumberjacks, surrounding
with axes, chopping at the bark
for homes, shelter, paper, money.
Bowing by the neck, how the larch
screams beneath the blades.
What will the neighbors say? 
A landscape stretched with forest.
Branches spread out as open arms,
on each living a family of leaves.
Trees understand why we carve
their bearded skin, they’re the oldest
living things on earth. 
I suspect that trees take pride
in being the true artisans
of the casket. Knowing more about
less makes us the least of what is
already here. By end life, we
will know as much 
			as wood.

Birth Of A Flower,"

Seeking petal perfection on
the wings of a seed.
Mating with the earth
in dark richness,
germinating transcendence.
Evolution bursts free,
spiraling ever upwards
to greet a bright reality.
Unfolding newborns,
velvet in their sheaths of green.
Begging the sky, they drink.
Perfect petals push their way
to efflorescence, lifting satin
faces to the sun in reverence.
Butterflies behold, as blossom
unfolds it’s glory for all to see.
The flower is born and Earth
weeps it’s blessings.
Gently grows the flower."

and its cruelty.  Wild

color reminds us
of the first light
of spring, the memory
that cannot be forgotten.

Blue Heron,"
Blue Heron
A great creature, serene
Stately at the edge of calm reflection
Unchanged throughout time
The same feathers, the same flight
The same
Reliable beauty and unending cadence
In journey, in sound, in season
Situates confused
In a complex of buzz and blunder
Humanity overflowing, streaming in metal confinements
Upon concrete interruptions
Oblivious
Living creatures that have lost their rhythm
There is no direction at hand with which to flee it
The noise, the menace
The absence of tranquility
The loss of harmony
The peril of death
Death
An infringement on the feathered comrade
A truth for the chaotic human

"
Butterfly,"
My romance with efflorescence in an arboretum,
Is the most picturesque moment in ultimatum.
I can decorate your garden in style,
Provided, you keep the flora in pride.
Elated to dabble with your child,
As long as, both of us get stirred.
I can pose in variety of striking colors,
Competing positively with seasonal flavors.
I am the world's most aesthetic insect,
With my graphics globally perfect.

"
Camping,"
What can we find
while camping?
Snuggle up in the bag
pull in your face
and re-breathe your air.
Doesn’t that feel warmer?
Get good rest, we have lots
to walk
tomorrow.
Did I tell you both
about the time
I did this with mom
and we out-walked
our sorrow?"
Carbonized Steaks ,"
More significant than the rise and fall,
More important than the historic events,
More woeful than pathetic deaths,
May we find occurring around us,
Unheeded, though trivial to the minds,
Yet gruesome to the unsealed eyeing hearts. 
Once aimless loitering through the forest,
Brought me to the blazing smoky spot,
Where wild flames were leaping up,
Encircling patches of the withering grass,
And barky beds of dry palm needles. 
My eyes captured a sight too horrible,
A tragedy performed away from the stage,
Beyond the sight of human busy eyes,
With no audience to applaud the struggle,
Or grieve at unjust agonizing infliction. 
A black partridge was fighting in panic,
Against the callous besieging yellow flames,
Each time belittling from all around,
The bird jumped to ward off the calamity,
As hapless men wheedle misfortune,
But in vain retreat with the gait reverse,
And when no one rescues, fight alone. 
Why it flies not, I wondered much,
To save the life, with the wings intact,
Relentless flames encroached instantly,
And burnt bones, flesh and feathers.
Curiosity took me then to the dismal spot. 
Ah! What a doleful thing I had to behold,
The belly seething with the burnt blood,
The motherhood all black, sooty smoked,
Lay singed among the seven babe birds,
Like steaks too carbonized to be eaten. 
When the victimizing gluttonous flames,
Rushed far away, I heard the weeping voices,
Of the sappy sticks of burning youngs,
Protesting against being blazed too soon.

"
Chainsaw versus the Pampas Grass,"
It seemed an unlikely match. All winter unplugged,
grinding its teeth in a plastic sleeve, the chainsaw swung
nose-down from a hook in the darkroom
under the hatch in the floor. When offered the can
it knocked back a quarter-pint of engine oil
and juices ran from its joints and threads,
oozed across the guide-bar and the maker’s name,
into the dry links. 
From the summerhouse, still holding one last gulp
of last year’s heat behind its double doors, and hung
with the weightless wreckage of wasps and flies,
mothballed in spider’s wool . . .
from there, I trailed the day-glo orange power line
the length of the lawn and the garden path,
fed it out like powder from a keg, then walked
back to the socket and flicked the switch, then walked again
and coupled the saw to the flex – clipped them together.
Then dropped the safety catch and gunned the trigger.
No gearing up or getting to speed, just an instant rage,
the rush of metal lashing out at air, connected to the mains.
The chainsaw with its perfect disregard, its mood
to tangle with cloth, or jewellery, or hair.
The chainsaw with its bloody desire, its sweet tooth
for the flesh of the face and the bones underneath,
its grand plan to kick back against nail or knot
and rear up into the brain.
I let it flare, lifted it into the sun
and felt the hundred beats per second drumming in its heart,
and felt the drive-wheel gargle in its throat.
The pampas grass with its ludicrous feathers
and plumes. The pampas grass, taking the warmth and light
from cuttings and bulbs, sunning itself,
stealing the show with its footstools, cushions and tufts
and its twelve-foot spears.
This was the sledgehammer taken to crack the nut.
Probably all that was needed here was a good pull or shove or a pitchfork to lever it out at its base.
Overkill. I touched the blur of the blade
against the nearmost tip of a reed – it didn’t exist.
I dabbed at a stalk that swooned, docked a couple of heads,
dismissed the top third of its canes with a sideways sweep
at shoulder height – this was a game.
I lifted the fringe of undergrowth, carved at the trunk –
plant-juice spat from the pipes and tubes
and dust flew out as I ripped into pockets of dark, secret warmth.
To clear a space to work
I raked whatever was severed or felled or torn
towards the dead zone under the outhouse wall, to be fired.
Then cut and raked, cut and raked, till what was left
was a flat stump the size of a barrel lid
that wouldn’t be dug with a spade or prised from the earth.
Wanting to finish things off I took up the saw
and drove it vertically downwards into the upper roots,
but the blade became choked with soil or fouled with weeds,
or what was sliced or split somehow closed and mended behind,
like cutting at water or air with a knife.
I poured barbecue fluid into the patch
and threw in a match – it flamed for a minute, smoked
for a minute more, and went out. I left it at that.
In the weeks that came new shoots like asparagus tips
sprang up from its nest and by June
it was riding high in its saddle, wearing a new crown.
Corn in Egypt. I looked on
from the upstairs window like the midday moon.
Back below stairs on its hook the chainsaw seethed.
I left it a year, to work back through its man-made dreams, to try to forget.
The seamless urge to persist was as far as it got.
Meaning of the Poem
This poem written by Armitage in 2002 is about a man using a chainsaw to cut down the pampas grass of South America. The chainsaw is ‘overkill’ where such a simple task is concerned: one doesn’t need to use an electric chainsaw to cut grass. But this is, as Armitage puts it, the sledgehammer taken to crack the nut. However, despite the chainsaw mowing down the grass with ease, the poem ends with a vision of the grass growing back, enduring despite the chainsaw’s best efforts to destroy it.

"
Colorado Midnight,"
We were the sound through the trees,
we were a creek, skirting the night.
Little flames, I could sing the hymns
of leaves. A glass flute led the melody. 
Our teeth grinned endless grins, glinting
like the eyelets of our shoes. We waded
across the water in echoes, in ripples.
The minnows caught the moon:
the fading light of stars in the morning,
the glow of embers under ash. The fish
always escaped our grasp. Their eyes
were hidden by water masks.

"
Come September,"
Come September!
Heart condense into magnetic acceptance
With blossoms of fragrant daisy
In the arid, dusty horizon of futility
The fine dusty soil once-
Gone with the wind
Homes on the barren heart
Comforting it, soothing it
Coating it with message immense
 Each step with white hope
The dream leaps in passion
On the rutted DE textured path
Moving on and on
The introverted lamp illuminates
At times sunnier, at times grey
But mostly stable
Then-
 The tempest distorts all
But the hand didn’t fail to gather straw
And make the roof again

Come una margherita,"
COME UNA MARGHERITA
Come una margherita
si scrolla e si piega
al crudo sferzare
del vento tagliente
e perde nel mentre
la bianca corolla
che a velo si spiega
nell'aria e sul mare,
così il mio cantare
si perde a brandelli
fra il noto alternarsi
di sole e di stelle,
quel pendolo folle
che secca la pelle,
imbianca la fronte
e spegne il dolore.
[Translation to English]
AS A DAISY
As a daisy
shakes and bends
at the crude lash
of the sharp wind
and lost in while
the white corolla
unfolding as a veil
in the air and upon the sea
so my singing
is lost in tatters
in the known rotation
of sun and stars,
that crazy pendulum
that dries the skin,
whitens the brow
and stifles the pain.

kiss my naked feet
bite them, if you think them sexy;
put your warmth
in every toe

kill the fungus if you find any there

and Oh, I so love your touch
and the way you bounce off my feet;
but you’re really greedy

Coral Beauty,"
Coral beauty on the effervescent sides of wet,
languidly bubbled, over each ecstasy of wave,
 in cornices of clinging, dumb with love that speaksIn a secret shore. Splurged, plunged,purged, of wave meeting rock, rock feasting waves,
 they pace the undercurrents of  the curvesOf  night touch, softly abdomened all over;
in  curls they snail , on, coved  beyond love’srequited seeking, nonplussed with ring waves of green wort,Of sea flora that cling with  clitoral gentleness ,before ecstasy turns to fail, and  they fall off
their orgasmic precipices, 
in muted crying to the lit night starsfor love, love's  ended  unending.

Crossing the Bar ,"

by Alfred Tennyson

Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea,
But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.
Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;
For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crost the bar.

"
Cry of the Betrayed Earth,"
From her womb
there seems to come the echo of a thousand souls:
“The earth is the bone of yours bones,
the flesh of your flesh,
and the shadow of your existence.”
Down in the womb of the earth
among the tea bundles and bones,
there lies a coffin…
There is a corpse rotting there
for each waltz and tango that play here.
There is a dark secret hidden below every feet of the earth.
The echo of a thousand souls is still haunting
those who are easily seduced.
The earth looked at me…its face wrinkled
like the face of an old sage.
I felt the shame in its faltering being,
an end less shame
Because I have betrayed it;
Because we have all betrayed it!…
In the end, though,
overwhelmed and amok,
poor like Job,
He returns back to the earth."
Cuchulain Comforted,"
A man that had six mortal wounds, a man
Violent and famous, strode among the dead;
Eyes stared out of the branches and were gone.
Then certain Shrouds that muttered head to head
Came and were gone. He leant upon a tree
As though to meditate on wounds and blood.
A Shroud that seemed to have authority
Among those bird-like things came, and let fall
A bundle of linen. Shrouds by two and thrce
Came creeping up because the man was still.
And thereupon that linen-carrier said:
'Your life can grow much sweeter if you will
'Obey our ancient rule and make a shroud;
Mainly because of what we only know
The rattle of those arms makes us afraid.
'We thread the needles' eyes, and all we do
All must together do.' That done, the man
Took up the nearest and began to sew.
'Now must we sing and sing the best we can,
But first you must be told our character:
Convicted cowards all, by kindred slain
'Or driven from home and left to dic in fear.'
They sang, but had nor human tunes nor words,
Though all was done in common as before;
They had changed their thtoats and had the throats of
birds."
days of quiet,"
here is the forest
the world withdraws a little;
quiet, silent and calm
the trees wait in their own nature
The morning is beautiful, the progress of the day smooth and the evening pleasant and the nights pensive and still. Time moves slowly and thought is as radiant as the sunlight that streams through.
Let us dwell here then a while, where it is peaceful. Let us rest us here awhile where the world drops off, distant from one.
the path leads nowhere
one is drawn to silence;
the leaves glisten
and the breeze speaks
of things past words
Let us rest then in this, where the clamor ceases, where beauty may keep one company.

"
Desert Song,"
Oh dune,
what's your alignment
in this arduous soil?
Do roaring decibels
mount your tongue
in the tune of a death march
to squeeze
unto undying armour of hope?
I eat the eyes that swallow you;
corrupt the minds which comfort you;
to feel how much you have grown
short; as stallions' scavenged zone.
Only as my heart reached harbour
that you planted scimitars here under
your fertile breath, that's weaving
some tapestry of arid thoughts.
Must I kill the spirits
that breed these lines,
or feed them again
with vintage spoons?
Still,
furnish me an oasis
of aged moons
or sit me amidst
oriental halls
and potent walls,
stirred by obscure hands
from afar.
Let me move at dwarf's length
to peer at your window
like you peer at mine;
so together, we watch
winged royalties in the sky;
flapping away imported dust
chewed on modern lips
that taste of strange champaign
which poisons the caverns within.
Oh, dune,
upon my frowning lamp
did I meet your faded ornaments;
but let me caress the hollows of your soul
and dent my mind
into you, for once,
as you rouse deep in my skin,
while I glare at your exotic eye
piercing through
my
ignorance.

Different ways of facing global warming,"
The official view,
Keep the oil economy running,
Just manage to minimize or neutralize new emissions,
Ensuring that those left without protection are few.
The skeptical environmentalist view,
Forget emissions and invest in renewable energy technology,
The social and environmental benefits of doing so are many,
Yet the official supporters are few.
The true sustainability view,
In the short term, tax the oil economy heavily,
And invest the proceed to develop long-term the clean economy,
One where social and environmental externalities are few.

O setting Sun

"
Endless boarder Line,"
Gaze by a flaming sight on a far distant altitude
Overshadowing hues sensation took over my grasp.
Displaying eloquence above two windows upright;
Though no comparison beyond soul in the dark.  
Vast reflection shattered golden color override;
Plentiful conception regard endless thyme canvass.
Tapered glass touches a human’s heart;
	Blowing blaze from the west cause swirling daffodils.
Gently waving my spirit to go free
Perhaps, sketching on the horizon of liberty.
Shouting far and deep, wide and infinite essence fee
Roaring wagon from enormous sea of galilee.
Making things anew by one stroke of hand
Redefining moment that captures autumn existence.
Masterpiece whom I call this humongous display of yours
With full of treasures of gold and where precious pearl invokes. 
Carry my soul, when I sleep in the dark.
Even assurance can be nowhere to found in the dungeon habitat.
Rise and search for me on the top
For you are thy hope of this ruined heart.

"
Endless Streams And Mountains,"
Ch'i Shan Wu Chin
Clearing the mind and sliding in
to that created space,
a web of waters steaming over rocks,
air misty but not raining,
seeing this land from a boat on a lake
or a broad slow river,
coasting by.
The path comes down along a lowland stream
slips behind boulders and leafy hardwoods,
reappears in a pine grove,
no farms around, just tidy cottages and shelters,
gateways, rest stops, roofed but unwalled work space,
—a warm damp climate;
a trail of climbing stairsteps forks upstream.
Big ranges lurk behind these rugged little outcrops—
these spits of low ground rocky uplifts
layered pinnacles aslant,
flurries of brushy cliffs receding,
far back and high above, vague peaks.
A man hunched over, sitting on a log
another stands above him, lifts a staff,
a third, with a roll of mats or a lute, looks on;
a bit offshore two people in a boat.
The trail goes far inland,
somewhere back around a bay,
lost in distant foothill slopes
& back again
at a village on the beach, and someone's fishing.
Rider and walker cross a bridge
above a frothy braided torrent
that descends from a flurry of roofs like flowers
temples tucked between cliffs,
a side trail goes there;
a jumble of cliffs above,
ridge tops edged with bushes,
valley fog below a hazy canyon.
A man with a shoulder load leans into the grade.
Another horse and a hiker,
the trail goes up along cascading streambed
no bridge in sight—
comes back through chinquapin or
liquidambars; another group of travelers.
Trail's end at the edge of an inlet
below a heavy set of dark rock hills.
Two moored boats with basket roofing,
a boatman in the bow looks
lost in thought.
Hills beyond rivers, willows in a swamp,
a gentle valley reaching far inland.
The watching boat has floated off the page.
?
At the end of the painting the scroll continues on with seals and
poems. It tells the a further tale:
""—Wang Wen-wei saw this at the mayor's house in Ho-tung
town, year 1205. Wrote at the end of it,
‘The Fashioner of Things
has no original intentions
Mountains and rivers
are spirit, condensed.'
‘. . . Who has come up with
these miraculous forests and springs?
Pale ink
on fine white silk.'
Later that month someone named Li Hui added,
‘. . . Most people can get along with the noise of dogs
and chickens;
Everybody cheerful in these peaceful times.
But I—why are my tastes so odd?
I love the company of streams and boulders.'
T'ien Hsieh of Wei-lo, no date, next wrote,
‘. . . The water holds up the mountains,
The mountains go down in the water . . .'
In 1332 Chih-shun adds,
‘. . . This is truly a painting worth careful keeping.
And it has poem-colophons from the Sung and the
Chin dynasties. That it survived dangers of fire and
war makes it even rarer.'
In the mid-seventeenth century one Wang To had a look at it:
‘My brother's relative by marriage, Wên-sun, is learned and
has good taste. He writes good prose and poetry. My broth-
er brought over this painting of his to show me . . .'
The great Ch'ing dynasty collector Liang Ch'ing-piao owned it,
but didn't write on it or cover it with seals. From him it went into
the Imperial collection down to the early twentieth century. Chang
Ta-ch'ien sold it in 1949. Now it's at the Cleveland Art Museum,
which sits on a rise that looks out toward the waters of Lake Erie.
?
Step back and gaze again at the land:
it rises and subsides—
ravines and cliffs like waves of blowing leaves—
stamp the foot, walk with it, clap! turn,
the creeks come in, ah!
strained through boulders,
mountains walking on the water,
water ripples every hill.
—I walk out of the museum—low gray clouds over the lake—
chill March breeze.
?
Old ghost ranges, sunken rivers, come again
stand by the wall and tell their tale,
walk the path, sit the rains,
grind the ink, wet the brushes, unroll the
broad white space:
lead out and tip
the moist black line.
Walking on walking,
under foot earth turns.
Streams and mountains never stay the same.

"
Engaged With A Tree,"
imps dance beneath your mighty arms
arms of undulating entanglements
fairies delight in your shadows of mirth
shadows that cast eerie faces upon the earth
I revel in the twisting designs you have created
awed by such devious and enchanting designs
you never repeat a single line
every line is unique to the others
where did you ever find the inspiration for such
the hours you have poured in each and every cell
the structure and the strength it took to remake each part
no one can ever pay enough homage to your genius
you stretch to honor the sun
the sun is your God
without whom you cease to exist
he has provided you with every necessary ingredient to exist
you drink in all the water you need
your roots fight through the soil and rock
the power you must have
you work each moment to grow and never rest
you must be driven by some desire to live
there must be some demon inside your being
some demonic force that drives you on
you stand against every natural force that comes
the wind tries to destroy you, yet you hold tight
with all your might 
                                         I have seen some of your kind that disappear in to the sky
so tall that my eye can no longer find your ending
so immense, so intense
so impossible to perceive in a single moment
I must walk away and come back to appreciate your splendor
I applaud your convictions
I worship at your feet
you are a wondrous sight to behold 
I weep at the sight on your demise
I cannot stand to see you suffer even a limb
I wonder if you cry as I do when a leave falls to it's death
you must have so much pride when every bud emerges in the spring
a brand new child comes forth, full of life and vigor
your arms give shelter to so many
I hope you do not mind the squatters who nestle in your bosom
they require so little
just a place to live and build a home
you are a generous being 
so many artists have tried to capture your grandeur
and so many will still continue
you present a challenge to us all
to tell your story
to absorb your essence, to be in your presence
we bow to you 
enraptured again and again at every turn
of every twist of every finger you create
you are an artist, a sculptor
you create with cellular matter
you must posses an extremely sensitive touch
like a fine watch maker
and the patience you must have
how do we begin to praise your work
how indeed do we even try
we are humbled by your endeavors
you are the king of life

"
Entropy,"
A nature full of savageness,
A gambling world in force
The Creation is a chaos-
Mare Cacophonous discourse.
I value myself the most;
Not that, I’m proud.
But there are so many ‘I’s
Amorphous in the Crowd.
Your pain is yours
Only you are there to feel
Your cry for life
Hardly makes a deal.
I know, they work,
Reconstruct over the ruins
To raise another empire
Lying dead under the plinths!
What are we running for?
What goal we gain,
When all are destined to
Get collapsed again?
Who’s the crazy behind?
And what’s the crazy theme?
Unrest drives the wheel
While Peace remains a dream.

At the brim of drowning day,
A slight after the sunset,
Clad in crimson pink bridal dress,
I see a bride every day exposing
Her unheeded, enthralling beauties,
Waiting for her courting partner,
Propping and fondling in both hands,
The silky locks of light and darkness,
And she ever stands for a while between,
Like a smart streak partitioning boundaries,
Of the shiny silvery day, dark shady night.

"
Failure Of Life,"
I always thought my past
My sorrows
My mistakes
My failure of life
Or thinking about my future
Without any plans, tries
Except living in the imaginations
And the desires
Never thought about today
In a result,
I have nothing
No past, no future
Today's sun is also going down
I have the same thoughts
And the same imaginations,
But no practical tries.
    ------------------"
Fall Job,"
How long have I been lying in these leaves?
…it’s best not to think about it.
It makes the time go by quicker.
But what else will I think about?
Will I think about the tall tree tops?
The hemlock is not as beautiful without its pines.
The maple is not as rich without its leaves.
But the squirrels still hop from tree to tree.
They chase each other, spiraling
down the oak tree, as if
gravity did not matter.
As if life were a carefree game.
They hop in and out of the leaves,
like gazelle,
squeaking with joy.
Their little feet crunch the crisp leaves.
They even run over me
as if I am part of the forest.
But I am not as pure as the air
nor moist as the ground.
The birds begin to chirp.
Their sweet voices fill the air
as if it were a sanctuary.
Now I know why he comes here.
Down the path I hear a brook,
with the gentle spray of its falls
and the rushing and brushing
against the rocks.
Up the trail comes a family of deer.
The children promenade with the swaying trees
and the parents sniff for food,
but they don’t smell me.
I’m glad I had this time.
No one else appreciates
the beauty of the world
more than our kind.
Then, another kind of sound
taints this utopia.
The loud patting of his despicable feet.
The panting of his heavy, foul breath.
Thank you forest for sharing your beauty.
I’m sorry it has to happen here.
(I set my sight on him
and begin to slowly tighten the trigger)"
Feast of the Eyes,"
This poem is all about how I see world from my eyes, my thought related to the universe and my importance towards it.
Immensely blue sky with white silvery clouds,
Seems as if it’s making some sound,
Transforming itself into dark all around,
That seems as if black curtains are turning round.
Drop by drop the curtain opens,
And looks like something’s have fallen,
Frolicking barefoot i feel them,
That helps me feel closer to the land.
The crispy and cool air breezing,
That caresses my face knocking,
Makes me feel refreshing,
Saying that I'm still yawning.
At night, when moon makes its appearance,
Seems as if it’s gazing the glory of universe,
Twinkling jewels adds to its beauty not to the worse,
Instead my senses make it more wondrous.
I feast my eyes upon the scene of immense activity,
And witness the nature’s beauty,
Preserving these is my duty,
Nevertheless i never allow it to gain someone’s sympathy.

"
Feelings,"
It`s raining out there in the night.
The fragrance of the `dark` air
and the surrounding tranquillity
gives my heart `wings`,
wings of freedom.
It makes the heart soar like a spirit free,
though `incomplete`,
perhaps looking for a heart `alike` .
The days won`t matter,
the wait won`t bother,
the faith won`t waver.I`m strong forever,
the `flowing sand` won`t worry me,
for in a corner of my heart there is
undefatigable hope,rather belief,
that hearts `alike` would someday unite,
and complement each other
and the union hence would `touch` away the pains forever."
Flight To Nature,"
SICK of the crowd, the toil, the strife,
Sweet Nature, how I turn to thee,
Seeking for renovated life,
By brawling brook and shady tree!
I knew thy rocks had spells of old,
To soothe the wanderer's woe to calm,
And in thy waters, clear and cold,
My fev'rish brow would seek for balm.
I've bent beneath thy ancient oak,
And sought for slumber in its shade,
And, as the clouds above me broke,
I dream'd to find the boon I pray'd;
For light--a blessed light--was given,
Wide streaming round me from above,
And in the deep, deep vaults of heaven,
There shone, methought, a look of love.
And, through the long, long summer hours,
When every bird had won its wing,
How sweet to think, amidst thy flowers,
That youth might yet renew its spring;--
That sacred season of the heart,
When every pulse with hope is strong,
And, still untaught by selfish art,
Truth fears no guile, and love no wrong.
And who, but nature's self, could yield
The blessing in the prayer I made,
Throned in her realm of wood and field,
Of rocky realm and haunted shade?
Who, but that magic queen, whose sway
Drives winter from his path of strife,
Whilst all her thousand fingers play,
With bud and bird, in games of life!
With these a kindred life I ask,--
Not wealth that mortals vainly seek;
But, in heaven's sunshine let me bask,
My heart as glowing as my cheek;--
An idle heart, that would not heed
That chiding voice, when duty comes,
To drag the soul, but freshly freed,
Back to cold toils and weary glooms.
No lure she finds in mortal schemes,
Which wiser fancies still reprove,--
Far happier in her woodland dreams,
With one sweet teacher, taught by love!
Thou, Nature, that magician be,
Restore each dream that taught the boy,
That warm'd his hope, that made him free,
While wisdom took the shape of joy;
And I will bless thee with a song,
As fond as hers, that idle bird,
That sings above me all day long,
As if she knew I watch'd and heard. "
Forgotten Language,"
Once I spoke the language of the flowers,
Once I understood each word the caterpillar said,
Once I smiled in secret at the gossip of the starlings,
And shared a conversation with the housefly
in my bed.
Once I heard and answered all the questions
of the crickets,
And joined the crying of each falling dying
flake of snow,
Once I spoke the language of the flowers. . . .
How did it go?
How did it go?"
Gazing At The Cloudy Sky,"
Gazing at the cloudy sky,
All I see is nowhere light;
Behind those puffs the stars profusely cry,
The battered moon stays behind in fright,
It could never win the fight.
The blowing wind being an artistic knife,
Makes the clouds in whites to paint the skies-
An afraid child left alone in his life,
Or a mighty eagle with watchful eyes,
Or a luxurious garden full of butterflies.
The dark sky lightens,
It is for sure the dawn of today;
Unlike the other bright items,
The clouds still float all gay,
Stirring under our petty planet in the milky way.
I watch the sun rise in the east,
Coloring the sky in picturesque shades;
Sinking all my troubles to the least,
Giving me a memory which for eternity stays,
The cloudy sky subtly fades.

"
God's Choir,"
On the eve of this beloved morn
When all light is bright and hot
The soft wind blows our ears
And heightens our senses to this loaded breeze
All who listen will perceive
This beautiful rhythm that the winds receive
From the birds' chirp to the scurrying mice
Arranged in an order so soothing and nice
Cocked ears perceive sweet music
Which fills our soul with eternal bliss
Our frowns turn to smiles
Our sweat become the drizzles
Which beat our tired skin and cools it
The sounds of God float through all space
Healing minds and hearts to trace
The beautiful path that his love makes
Sweet music that lingers on
Without a touch of flute or harp
Sweet melodies that give life
All writ and inspired by god himself
Sweet melodies of his word
Hear the sweet psalms
That clean our fear and worry
Hear the sweet psalms of his grace and glory
Sang by all with blood and heart
Hear now and sing your part
To gods everlasting love and might

gum tree loved by the sky,"
there’s this gum tree
that stands alone
its skin and bark white as bone
and its leaves
quivering in the wind
shimmering
in the sun;
and it’s so pretty
and tall and proud
the blue sky says:
“I'll come stand
guard over you
embrace you
full of blue love”

Hey birds,"
Hey birds
you rosellas and mynas
and magpies
it’s nice Spring and the flowers
are in bloom
in my garden;
and it’s good to see you flying about
as in a Walt Disney movie
and see you hover at the flowers
or on the lawn
but really, must you sit on the fence
and shit on my side of the garden?
why don’t you turn your butt around
and drop it in my neighbor’s colorless yard?

Hiking,"
between two tall skeletons of birches
i walk right into the heart of mid-autumn
with the city gate as my starting point
but without any predetermined destination
along a less frequently trodden trail
i keep traveling behind my own soul
each time I climb onto a little ridge
i see another higher up just ahead
it is not a question of uphill or downhill
nor a choice between two different roads
once standing on the peak to look back
i find all mountains so surprisingly small

"
His Escape,"
Waves crashing on the shore,
shells scattered around
seem endless as he glances
down the shoreline.
Tiny crabs skitter
by his boots in the sand.
As he walks further out,
water rises up,
awakening his soul.
He finds just the right site
to make his first cast.
Only the echo of the waves
and the click of his reel
bring him peace and serenity.
The rhythm of these sounds
carries him
away from the noises
of buildings being constructed,
phones ringing,
and the chime of yet another email.
The resonance and feel of
the water
lapping against his waist
relaxes him
and lifts his worries away.

"
Hora Stellatrix,"
The stars hang thick in the apple tree,
The south wind smells of the pungent sea,
Gold tulip cups are heavy with dew.
The night's for you, Sweetheart, for you!
Starfire rains from the vaulted blue.
Listen! The dancing of unseen leaves.
A drowsy swallow stirs in the eaves.
Only a maiden is sorrowing.
'T is night and spring, Sweetheart, and spring!
Starfire lights your heart's blossoming.
In the intimate dark there's never an ear,
Though the tulips stand on tiptoe to hear,
So give; ripe fruit must shrivel or fall.
As you are mine, Sweetheart, give all!
Starfire sparkles, your coronal."
Hound Voice,"
Because we love bare hills and stunted trees
And were the last to choose the settled ground,
Its boredom of the desk or of the spade, because
So many years companioned by a hound,
Our voices carry; and though slumber-bound,
Some few half wake and half renew their choice,
Give tongue, proclaim their hidden name -- 'hound voice.'
The women that I picked spoke sweet and low
And yet gave tongue. 'Hound voices' were they all.
We picked each other from afar and knew
What hour of terror comes to test the soul,
And in that terror's name obeyed the call,
And understood, what none have understood,
Those images that waken in the blood.
Some day we shall get up before the dawn
And find our ancient hounds before the door,
And wide awake know that the hunt is on;
Stumbling upon the blood-dark track once more,
Then stumbling to the kill beside the shore;
Then cleaning out and bandaging of wounds,
And chants of victory amid the encircling hounds."
Human kind please hear the warning,"
Development facts,
Global warming issues,
Sustainability limits,
The world is held by weak strings.
Economies are growing,
Environmental quality is declining,
Social inequalities are deepening,
And therefore, the climate change box is expanding.
Human kind please hear the warning,
Under global warming,
Eco-economic agents can not pass the sustainability test
If they themselves become sources of deeper social unrest.

I am content here
in my open
with the trees and the birds that sing
and the clouds above
and the moon that radiates at night;
and the feel of the warmth of the sun on my
arms and chest and legs
and the feel of the cool water
on my face;
not for me all the revelations
and the vanities
and the theories
and the pomposity
of the life here
and the life hereafter;
for I am content here
in my open
with the trees and the birds that sing

"
I Left All Liars,"
I have left all liars
Including innocent
I could not do else
Except that
I needed to relax
Anyhow,
They deserve
The special thanks
For they awoke me
They taught me
They showed me
The reality and life
The value of the truth
I do not notice them anymore
I do not feel any devotion
Affection, respect for them
I had once thought
Such people are the ugly blemish
On the humanity
I believe
God protects the good ones
From such people
I pray, and I hope
I stay safe, and far from them."
I like to let the word fly about,"
        I like to let the word fly about
	Not tied down to its meanings
	Like a dog on a leash
	And be walked on the beach.
	But let it prance around, flip and turn
	And perch on the tiniest branch
	Of suspense and dream
	In the balmy glow of a rainbow
	Like a crazy cormorant
	Caring not a fig for gravity.
	I like to let the word
	Make mouths of mockery
	At those who take it to mean
	Like sea and sea weed moth-green
	I like to clutch them and scooping
	Fling handfuls into the sky
	And watch them rain
	Poetry.

I Wish,"
I wish I was a bird
That my song the world might be heard
And soar up in the big blue sky
To see the wonders that caught my eye.
I wish I was a flower
That blooms beautiful easing anger
Kissed by, early morning sunlight
Adorned by thousands of amazing might.
I wish I was the sun
That shines bright across the land,
Gives joy to every living face,
and bring broken hearts into one piece.
I wish I was a tree
Growing strong the world could ever see
Sheds my loved ones beneath its ring
Like a beautiful-feathered humming bird sing.
And yet, I am what I am today
Not a bird, a flower, a sun nor a tree
Because God made me special, you see?
More than any wish I could ever be.

"
If I Were a Tree,"
What would I do if I were a tree?
I’d regard life in the surrounds.
Mankind would live within nature’s law,
Respecting the natural compounds.
What would I do if I were a tree?
Regenerate earth’s atmospheres.
Mankind would inhale nature’s fresh breath,
Across the world’s vast hemispheres.
What would I be if I were a tree?
Majestic and free as I grew.
Mankind would be left to live and grow,
And the earth as one would renew.
What would I see if I were a tree?
I’d see beauty in life around.
Mankind would see the beauty in me,
In harmony life would abound.

In The Seven Woods,"
I have heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods
Make their faint thunder, and the garden bees
Hum in the lime-tree flowers; and put away
The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness
That empty the heart. I have forgot awhile
Tara uprooted, and new commonness
Upon the throne and crying about the streets
And hanging its paper flowers from post to post,
Because it is alone of all things happy.
I am contented, for I know that Quiet
Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart
Among pigeons and bees, while that Great Archer,
Who but awaits His hour to shoot, still hangs
A cloudy quiver over Pairc-na-lee.

Insect's Nest,"
When it came and built the frame
on the wall,
briskly I bruised it
by a finger.
Twice it came again
I ignored it then.
Now on the wall it has a shelter
at the back of my computer;
a frail one inch hollow tube
upside open downside closed
clipped to the wall.
It’s a tiny wasp
may be with family it lives;
 they come and go.
Ain’t all the great constructions
like insect’s nest
brittle and fragile
sure to go
today or tomorrow
measured by time?
Why bother about any mark made of lime?

"January, January...","

Ice, thick,
as I have never seen
on Cherwell.
Jagged, floating towards Isis.
Low mists of ice-dust
drift on Christ Church meadow
and cool the blood
of long-horn cattle
standing
ankle-deep in mud.
A lame roe deer
beneath the trees
pauses, where
the sudden call of coots
splits the air.
In the gardens of Trinity,
all is order and harmony.
January blossom from Japan,
well-kept paths and lawns.
Controlled
and quiet.
Magdalen is a small, medieval town;
courtyards and golden houses,
a Tower and a Park.
Along Addison’s Walk,
tall trees like sentries,
follow the stream
which sidles out from Magdalen Bridge
to turn and twist
past the Deer Park
with its white deer,
(living, condensations
of the mist).

Lakes,"
The lake of ice is lacerated with blanching scratches.
Figures merry with winter move on it and freeze
Spewed out of somewhere by blind time
That burns on and is there.
The second lake above, crossed with gashes of light and cloud,
Which has been the eternal witness of time and abided with it,
Is surprised by a sharp-tipped circling aircraft or some other moon of man,
Splitting its waves wide open.
The blueblade knives of the ice
Will be like flowers in remembrance
In which the shades of snow glide down
Like silver and like wool.
Before melody flickers its last on a lake
And the knowable world is passed away."

Day bows before me as
Night writes a
Storyline of
Sewing windscorpion
Shadows thirteen inches
Tall.

Leering Mockingbird

let the calm of the evening,"
let the calm of the evening
let it descend in our hearts;
embrace
its coolness and its quiet
its invitation to thought and reflection;
let its peace
let its power come in;
and perhaps let us put aside
all our concepts and vengeance
and perhaps in this quiet
see the anarchy in one’s heart,
and leave all tension, all misgivings
and see the stillness within oneself
as in this evening;
and perhaps then one sees all the calm and peace
and the love
and the oneness
and may that be in one
all days and all nights

Little Tree,"
little tree
little silent Christmas tree
you are so little
you are more like a flower
who found you in the green forest
and were you very sorry to come away?
see i will comfort you
because you smell so sweetly
i will kiss your cool bark
and hug you safe and tight
just as your mother would,
only don't be afraid
look the spangles
that sleep all the year in a dark box
dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,
the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,
put up your little arms
and i'll give them all to you to hold
every finger shall have its ring
and there won't a single place dark or unhappy
then when you're quite dressed
you'll stand in the window for everyone to see
and how they'll stare!
oh but you'll be very proud
and my little sister and i will take hands
and looking up at our beautiful tree
we'll dance and sing
""Noel Noel"""
Loon Point,"
Softly the water ripples
Against the canoe's curving side,
Softly the birch trees rustle
Flinging over us branches wide.
Softly the moon glints and glistens
As the water takes and leaves,
Like golden ears of corn
Which fall from loose-bound sheaves,
Or like the snow-white petals
Which drop from an overblown rose,
When Summer ripens to Autumn
And the freighted year must close.
From the shore come the scents of a garden,
And between a gap in the trees
A proud white statue glimmers
In cold, disdainful ease.
The child of a southern people,
The thought of an alien race,
What does she in this pale, northern garden,
How reconcile it with her grace?
But the moon in her wayward beauty
Is ever and always the same,
As lovely as when upon Latmos
She watched till Endymion came.
Through the water the moon writes her legends
In light, on the smooth, wet sand;
They endure for a moment, and vanish,
And no one may understand.
All round us the secret of Nature
Is telling itself to our sight,
We may guess at her meaning but never
Can know the full mystery of night.
But her power of enchantment is on us,
We bow to the spell which she weaves,
Made up of the murmur of waves
And the manifold whisper of leaves."
Madonna of the Evening Flowers,"
All day long I have been working,
Now I am tired.
I call: “Where are you?”
But there is only the oak tree rustling in the wind.
The house is very quiet,
The sun shines in on your books,
On your scissors and thimble just put down,
But you are not there.
Suddenly I am lonely:
Where are you?
I go about searching.
Then I see you,
Standing under a spire of pale blue larkspur,
With a basket of roses on your arm.
You are cool, like silver,
And you smile.
I think the Canterbury bells are playing little tunes.
You tell me that the peonies need spraying,
That the columbines have overrun all bounds,
That the pyrus japonica should be cut back and rounded.
You tell me these things.
But I look at you, heart of silver,
White heart-flame of polished silver,
Burning beneath the blue steeples of the larkspur,
And I long to kneel instantly at your feet,
While all about us peal the loud, sweet Te Deums of the Canterbury bells."
Meanderings,"
The gusty, blustery wind
lifted and tossed
all sorts of light and flighty things
litter, leaves and paper
nimbly swirling, wafting, floating
nosediving
near the ground and pulling out
dropping then lifting again
as branches and leaves from trees
waved agitatedly
the dark, ominously majestic pines
elegant poplars
oaks and aspens
shrubs with flowers
and distinctive leaves
like small children
or relatives of the trees
all being harried and blown about.

"
Meilleures ennemies,"
Miroir, mon beau miroir,
Tu me contemples
Et te déhanches,
Je te sais penchée aux fontaines,
Je te sens grisée aux orages.
Tu glisses lente et cristalline
Aux joues offertes et désarmées.
O Miroir, féroce insoumise
Impitoyable, sibylline,
Jalouse d’étreindre à sa guise,
J’ai inventé nos ressemblances,
Tissé le fil
De ce langage insoupçonné
Et de nos fusions infidèles.
O mon miroir, ma jumelle,
Mon inconnue si familière,
Que j’aime t’entendre aux fenêtres
Et te porter nue à mon cou.
Mais tes insondables colères
N’épargnent guère
Ni ne pardonnent,
Dans tes fracas, dans tes conquêtes,
Dans tes corps à corps aux falaises.
Tu me terrifies, ô Miroir,
Effrontée sublime et sauvage.
Puis tu souris
Insolemment.
Et je m’incline, consentante,
Face à la mer.

Mocking Bird,"
Oh, poor, innocent captive bird
How my heart aches for thee -
How I wish thou couldst spread thy wings
And, in thy innocence, fly free!
O’er woods and meadows, lakes and fells
Singing out thy joyous song -
To be imprisoned in this way
Is so hideous and wrong.
Maybe, little plaintive bird,
Whence from Life thou hast passed away,
O’er Elysian fields shalt thy spirit soar
And, in freedom, fly each day
Sailing upon the buoyant winds -
Gently buffeting thy frame
Wherein soft whispers shall be heard
Of Angels calling thee by name
Until such time sweet, gentle bird,
Fate has deemed thee thy time to spend
Behind these bars that mock thy wings
From dawn ‘til twilight’s end.

"
Moonbeam flowers,"
In the twilight morning seeking flowers in the garden lit in tender grins I found those moonbeam flowers smiling at me casting the light of serene white. With raindrops upon their petals shining, pleading me to touch it’s bracing self and I felt of embracing them all to my bare chest warm of coolest shower. Birds sing songs celestial, breeze blows gentle and I remain mesmerised with a heart rejoicing the grace of unspoken words!         
The sanctum sanctorum is ready, I have bathed the idol and lit lights divine. With a corbeille when I stood amidst the green, I wanted those flowers to offer unto His feet. Alas! here I am left with frozen fingers unable to pluck them from their very being. The leaves of Tulsi are still, awaiting the pain of possible death - my fingers separating them from their stems! Alas! my Lord, nor I want to see that aching heart and its bleeding fragrance!  
Perhaps I may have to return with an empty basket that was always full of heavenly flowers. My Lord, here I am with bare hands of agony, grand me with a vision that would let me love them more than You, and leave me content with my heart’s heart. If passiveness would bring joy abundant to the world, let my words spread it among the people all around me. I will sing the glory of you, but accept me for what I am and for what I have. 
Dawdling through the soil wet of yester-rain, the path ends at the door of your abode. While trying to sing along the pitch of the breeze, why are these teardrops oozing out from my eyes instead of the melody from the bottom of my throat? Amidst the joyful chirping of these birds, why am I left silent to the deepest of my self? There is silence deep within the self of everyone and everything- my Lord, shall I call thee that name?
It is morning! Within the sanctum sanctorum when I close my eyes with silent prayers quivering on my lips, I can see those moonbeam flowers smiling at her beloved who is peeping through the clouds in the eastern horizon; I can breath deep the fragrance of unwounded Tulsi leaves ready to be kissed by the tender rays of the Lord of light! O beloveds, fall unto the lap of mother earth when you die, to feed the lives yet to sprout.  
My Lord, here I am, accept this humble me as the offering and here is this life upon thy feet!

"
Mother Earth; Her Beauty And Her Destruction,"
I awake to hear her voices, her smells bring me alive, and Mother Earth is all around me wanting for me to step outside.
I see her creatures playing, the birds singing a tune, and the grasses are swaying to her sweet breaths perfume.
Beauty is all around me, life in full bloom, waiting for the next season to come to return to her womb.
Horses are galloping, Cows graze in her fields, little creatures run and play tag with their meals.
Mother Earth is abundant with all life to give, spreading her seed so she will continue to live.
While humans degrade her and spill filth on her skin, she moans and cries for healing to begin. Her trees have been taken, her body been raped, Her blood has been poisoned her waters not safe, her air has been polluted no clean breath to take, fires running ramped burning her kin, while she waits for new life to begin.
Mother Earth is so precious; she needs to be healed, so once again life can be revealed.
The Earth needs our help, letting her heal, keeping her clean so she can reveal
All beauty she holds, all the wonders she keeps, the wisdom she bestows, all while she weeps.
The garbage that’s tossed on her beautiful skin, all the toxins that’s dropped in waters with in, all the air filled with smoke that chokes up her lungs, with the fires that reap all her creatures she loves, she’s making a plea for all to stop, while we close up our ears and continue with out stop.
Please make it stop so she can continue to live, she screams from her bountiful body with in.
We take and we scar her beautiful land, we make her air thick so her smells we can’t stand, the water we pour all the chemicals in is making it hard for her fishes to swim.
We blow stuff up and burn all her land making it hard for all the trees to stand. Her creatures are tossed out in the cold, leaving them homeless with no place to go.
We must stop this get it to end for our mother is weeping and can’t understand; with all of her beauty and all of her love why would some body do this to a mother supposed to be loved.
This has to end before it’s too late, she’ll take all her love and leave us to fate.
She will make a new start and sweep all her lands leaving it clean for her next children too stand.

"
Mother Nature,"
You melt the dreams,
Into the liveliest colors of Life.
All until the iron curtain;
In our souls
Emerged into reality.
In your blessed chest,
I heard the echo of a thousand souls;
Your Clouds intertwine,
They strained in a wonderful,
Sweet despair,
Awaiting the first lightning;
Your mountains rustle with the breath of Life,
Your winds wave,
With the gigantic wings of life;
Your green valleys,
Open, welcoming, full of flowers,
That eternal, blissful smile of deity,
In that charming gaze,
Of your green valley,
It seemed to me
That they represent your thirst,
And your expectations,
Your longing for the love of men."
Mother Nature,"
Since the beginning of the Earth,
Millions of years back
You came into existence.
Water began to flow upon your Heart,
Sunrays fall unto your surface,
Seeds began to germinate.
You nourishes this germinating seeds
Into a full-fledged plant.
Leaves began to appear,
Stem protrudes side by side.
Flower buds appear,
Attracting the Birds & Bees.
Meanwhile, they began to build their shelter.
By then, your whole surface
Is cover up by green grasses
And by green trees,
Letting our planet appears lively again.

Mother Ocean,"
Ancient of days,
Deep to endless fathoms,
Mysterious to the infinite,
Vast expanse of liquid space,
Woman of Timeless Beauty.
Enraged, you batter relentlessly all that you encounter,
Tranquil, your peace transcends time and worry.
You teem with unseen life
While jealously guarding the Secrets of the Dead.
Your salty tears honor the lost.
Friend of many shores,
You are my Peace.
Away from you...
I still dream of your midnight tides,
As they rush in with a deafening roar,
Then quickly retreat in a sizzling clatter,
Leaving gifts of shell jewels behind
Glistening in your silvered wake.
Earth’s moon,
Your silent observer,
Holds eternal vigil
As it transforms your shimmering face into an
Indigo Sea of Diamonds.
Mother Ocean,
Your child longs for you.
I will return to your

My Heart Urges,"
My heart urges for the sun,
To enkindle its dark world;
For the moon,
To relish with the vision,
Of extended charm of the sky,
Adorned with the golden ornaments;
For the dew drops,
To savour coolness of the dawn;
For the rose,
To experience intoxicating fragrance;
For the breeze,
To be caressed with gentle kisses;
For the sandy beach,
To offer my feet to the waves,
To be touched with the liquid fingers,
Where I might find myself,
A goddess and the waves the devotees,
Rushing for the sacred touch;
For the polite gentle love packed words;
That might blot the fatigue, tedium,
Of tiresome tedious life;
For the long sojourn at night,
To be led to clear clean lake,
Where I might find the glimpse,
Glimmering reflection of the moon,
With myriad stars:
Thoroughly another reflected world of illusion;
For the liberty of a cloud,
That rides floats unchained,
On the shoulders of the wind.

Nature,"
The sunlight seeping through the trees,
The wind whispering to the leaves,
The  green carpeted moss hugging the branches of the trees,
The velvet kisses of the breeze,
My fiery hair fluttered gently without a sound,
while the star like diamonds danced on the autumn ground,
Memories flew back knocking at my door,
What a enchanting vision to endure,
I swirled around under the half cast shadows of the day,
while the serene noises forcing me to sway,
round and round and round I twirled,
remembering the beauty of our world.

"
Nature - Am I still Beautiful,"
Her once fresh water trickling with grace,
Now flows with grime that’s difficult to clean.
Her once fresh air that sustained life,
Now have toxins that slays.
Her velvety green gown of forest and grass,
Now have torn patches and crests of waste.
Her beautiful ornaments with diamonds of snow,
Now has melted to floods that ruin.
Her flawless skin texture that radiated beauty,
Now have scars and fine lines of mines.
Her speech that sounded chirrup and tweet,
Now has turned to screams of traffic and blasts.
Her attire of diversity full of flowers and creatures,
Now has shrinked and faded away with heat.
Distressed by her loss nature asked – Am I still beautiful!!
With little hope in her eyes she iterated – Can I be beautiful again!!

Preach me something new...

Nature Trail,"
At the bottom of my garden
There's a hedgehog and a frog
And a lot of creepy-crawlies
Living underneath a log,
There's a baby daddy long legs
And an easy-going snail
And a family of woodlice,
All are on my nature trail.
There are caterpillars waiting
For their time to come to fly,
There are worms turning the earth over
As ladybirds fly by,
Birds will visit, cats will visit
But they always chose their time
And I've even seen a fox visit
This wild garden of mine.
Squirrels come to nick my nuts
And busy bees come buzzing
And when the night time comes
Sometimes some dragonflies come humming,
My garden mice are very shy
And I've seen bats that growl
And in my garden I have seen
A very wise old owl.
My garden is a lively place
There's always something happening,
There's this constant search for food
And then there's all that flowering,
When you have a garden
You will never be alone
And I believe we all deserve
A garden of our own. "
Nature's Bride,"
The porcelain empyreal
Blended itself
Like a bride
In the palette of
Amber blush.
It contoured it's
Cheek bones of mounts
With liquid onyx,
With ruby mascara
It mascaraed it's lashed rays
That curled down
On the waterline of its eyes,
And with the orange veil
It cloaked & hid it's
Shy face covering and
Containing the sky.

Nature’s song for the children,"

stand up and wipe those tears;
smile and laugh
in your love
of the fields and the stars
smile and laugh
little darlings;
smile and laugh
in your love
of the birds and trees
and the streams
and the creatures
of the earth
smile and laugh
in your love of the clouds
and the sunshine and the berries
and the flowers
and the butterflies;
smile little children
with that love
that is radiant in your hearts
stand up, children
stand up and wipe those tears;
smile and laugh
in your love
of the fields and the stars
2
stand up, children
stand up and wipe those tears;
smile and laugh
in your love
of the fields and the stars
though all things may pass
and all things may change
and iron hands
and powder powers
bring chaos and bareness;
and these things may hurt
even those light hearts of yours -
still, delicate angels,
there is love
in your darling hearts
so bring them your love
of the sunshine
and your love of the trees;
bring them your love
of the land
and your love of life
bring them your love
of the skies
and your love of the bees;
bring them your love
of the streams, air and earth
for the love that you have
that is oneness
that love never passes;
that is the love
that abides always
in all change and passing
stand up, children
stand up and wipe those tears;
smile and laugh
in your love
of nature and the stars

Nestling,"
When to summon the sky
Little nestling?
When to summon the sky?
And suffer the risk – abscond in dread –
The knowledge of sort that you’ll be dead
Upon a calamitous fall;
Or taken in flight – a hawkish pounce –
Demolished as prey; your fate pronounce
You gone and to never recall.
O when to summon the sky
Little nestling?
When to summon the sky?
Aborting a den with
Feathered bed,
Unwavering mother who
Saw you fed –
Surrendering all so
You may spread
Your reach of tentative wings! 
‘Tis only instinct –
E’er the reason –
Forging life:
The Nesting Season
And the trials it brings.
So up and summon the sky
Little nestling,
Up! and summon the sky!

Nevertheless,"
At night
When the cloud
Was a moon-headed eagle
There were also
Entities in the brain
And airplanes flew
Between
The troposphere and the stratosphere
It was so cerebral
And the flowers declared
Existence too
In the day after
A cumulonimbus came so close to me
That I could even hear
The sounds in its lungs
If they were in the brain then
If they were only
Metaphysical propositions
Neither analytic nor empirically verifiable
And therefore meaningless
Nevertheless…

"
NOCHE MARINA,"
Era noche cerrada
sólo estaba el mar y yo,
las olas iban y venían
y en cada ola juguetona y traviesa
les cantaban alegremente
a los botes mecidos por el vaivén de las aguas
y a las redes de los pescadores.
Ya los hombres de mar comenzaban a llegar
para irse en sus barcas a las profundidades del mar
llegaba la hora de ir por la pesca del día,
el agua se agitaba
y tan sólo quedaban estelas en la mar.
Más atrás iba en mi pequeña barca
pero a solas, no iba él
me adentraba con mi carga de recuerdos
sin prisa, sin impaciencia, sin rumbo
pero no estaba él,
el que me alegraba la existencia.
Para que la prisa si  no lo encuentro
hace tiempo que se me perdió
por eso lo busco en el silencio de la mar
me acompaña la oscura noche,
me acompaña  el vaivén de las olas,
de pronto siento su presencia
es el dueño de mi vida,
el que me dió la existencia,
la búsqueda ha terminado, estoy con él.

O lovely Oryx,"
The bright yellow object is becoming faint
Its face now looks pale
Like one crippled with fear, eyes knit
Aye, it cannot notice the rail
Look, look it does not even wait
Now that it has lost its sharp eyes
It is running away
Alas, it feels inferior, sad and wearied
Because it noticed the coming of the white faced
Walking gallantly because of its heaven face
O lovely Oryx!
Gather all you can of thy daily bread
And into the woods seek shelter
Before the jungle’s king take thee for supper
For in the face of this white faced it takes you prey.

O! December ,"
O! December,
When you come this turn again,
Bring along,
Reports of the city,
The city that dwells in my heart.
Where glimmer galaxies
Of glow-worms,
Where spheres smile,
With the colours of butterflies,
Where all around lingers
Fragrance of faithfulness,
And that who feels it
With the finger-tips,
Or gets its glance
Becomes fragrance incarnated. 
 O! December,
When you come this turn again,
Bring along
Reports of the city,
The city that dwells in my heart.
Where grains of sand
Are the stars,
Where roses and nightingales,
The months and Moon
Are metaphors of truthfulness;
Where heart is an ocean
With several banks
And where the Deity of Fate
Sparkles in the fists. 
O! December,
Ask us not about
The plight our own city;
Here rests in the eyes,
The dust of passed caravans,
Love is cold like an iceberg,
And grows
In the farms of sunlight,
Here when the dawn approaches,
All visions of the night melt
In the form of a thawing heap,
Here prick in the eyes,
Bits of the broken passions,
Here we weave our dreams,
By dipping lashes
In the blood of heart,
Then we live and we die
In those dreams;
Though it is not possible
To stitch words of the ragged soul,
Yet O! December,
 When you come this turn again
Bring along
Reports of the city,
The city that dwells in my heart.

"
Ode to a River,"
Ode to a River
As I sit in solitude by her side
The morning rays of sunshine sets the river alive
The heavenly clouds from above they peer
Softly into hear ears the wind whisper
And she replies gently with a murmur
Life a youthful maiden, shy yet brave
With eyes open wide in curious delight
She continues her voyage with courage and might
Like an adorned princess so complete in grace
In path unforeseen, she offers herself again and again.
In her sweet genteel playful moods
She blesses everything by her touch
And in occasional angrier times
She outbursts her emotions, in ravage and destruction much
But only to forgive and be forgotten soon enough. 
As I watch her flow by in spellbound captivity
Lo, behold , I never come across such a beauty
Slowly as the vision fades away,
Imperfect thoughts hovering in mind
I try to trace her origins
But from whence she comes nobody knows.

"
Ode to Mother Nature,"
In the service of its majesty- art,
I am flying on the wings of verses,
From heart to heart of everyone,
Because each person's tear is the same color.
Green as a young leaf today,
I am holding on to my tree - mankind,
Tomorrow as a dead dry leaf -
Thorn away from my mother tree,
On the soft back of the wind I travel
From century to century, on the paths of eternity.
In the service of her majesty- poetry,
I voice myself in verses:
""Look at the enchanting face of Mother Nature, man!
Can't you see the pearly tear, half-lit
By the reflection of the heavenly dawn
On the face of Earth?
Its virgin face - lit by the aura of God's mercy -
Hiding behind the oblique veil of death.
Don't you understand, man,
That nature can go on without you,
But you can't go on without nature?""
In the service of her majesty- Mother Nature,
I seek shelter for my wounded heart in prayers,
Because greed not only destroys the soul of mankind,
But the heart of Mother Nature too,
In deserts, black, red and blue seas
There are dark towers rising,
Thrusting its fangs into the heart of nature.
Black streams flow through its silent chest,
Like poisoned blood.
There are no more songs left in Mother Nature's lap,
Only seductive murmurs of black streams of oil,
The silence of dried up wells,
And the echo of stock brokers,
Who do not care for the wind's accusing scream.
In the service of its majesty, the soul,
I solemnly declare to the world:
""Without Mother Nature,
My voice would become inaudible.
Imagination, so irrepressibly flowing
Into the white stream of my inebriated dreaming,
Would leave so little trace behind
As does an abandoned orphan;
Without Mother Nature, my wings-verses wouldn't be there
For me to travel from heart to heart of everyone."""
Old Redwood Tree,"
I watch the sunrise
Skies spread wide and bright, as the hiding night slowly slinks away.
From lofty, misty highs, my teary eyes see fog and vapour chased by morning's gaze.
Stale shadow covers shrink and disappear, 'til crisp, clean air
around me
lingers
as
I sway.
Together we are, breathing as one, feeding the world and fed by the sun, yet each tree we are -
one hand bound in earthy glove, and one held high and open – free.
My branches to the wind bend and shake; a thousand sails
sailing
daylight's
shoreless
lake.
I've seen beasts and mice and bugs play and live in the forest rug of leaves and mud and twigs
and dew that fall from me, and them, and you.
And I've seen endless plants grow up, and die; though none get so tall as I, the
Great old
redwood
tree.
And should sky's tired wings seek rest, my arms will stretch to meet them; leafy hands round all will bow til sun should rise again. Then, warm light gently through my fingers dapples, morning melodies ring out, and bid my buds to come to flower, gracefully, til
Comes the
autumn
hour

"
On A Cyclamen,"
This fragrant plant from sunny Italy,
Plucked by our passing hand, was homeward brought:
Memorial of that favoured clime to be,
And minister sweet food to retrospective thought.
Unchecked in growth, it well repays our care,
Gladdening our cottage with its constant bloom:
By nature prompted, half the varied year;
The other,--gay in honour of its new--found home.
Thick bank, beneath a crumbled mass
Of ancient stone--work, by Piano's lake,
Thy fellows cluster yet, and they who pass
See yet their turbaned flowerets to the breezes shake.
The life of Nature's children, who can tell?
What grand old tales their history may hide,
How world--wide empires by them rose and fell,
Or Caesars trampled o'er them in their legioned pride?
Led by thy scent, perchance, some glorious morn,
Stopped the Cisalpine shepherd as he past,
Built his low hut beneath the sheltering thorn,
And in the doorway sitting, ate his mean repast.
Then a fair garland of his home's own flowers
Culled for the peasant girl he loved the best;
Worn in the first bright day of married hours,
Lapt soft between the hillocks of her panting breast.
So years went on:--that bank his children knew,
Loved the bright rosy tints thy bloom--cups shed,
Oft bathed their limbs in summer's freshest dew
In childhood's naked gambols on thy leafy bed.
Lo, other climes and ways await thee now:
Warm wrapt and weather--fenced our forms pass by:
Safe housed with sheltering glass above thee, thou
Amidst mock summers lift'st to Heaven thy laughing eye.
Play on, thou little fount of blameless joy,
Freshening our souls through many a weary time;
Gladdening the stately hours of high employ,--
As blest in Britain's mists, as erst in happier clime."
On A May Glory-A Welcome Song,"
O' sprite full Maia,come attire our lands with your boundless prize,
Of joyful swelling by the natures pleasing bloom,and green surprise;
To sprout a floral bedding round the yards and shades for worthy dales--
For birds to spin their adorned bowers over the dewy boughs and vales.
Hail! to you goddess--deck the forest's lingering beauty,thus come---
Let streams do flow across the thick and bushy meadows over your prime,
For hawthorn white and lilies to bud,and converse fragrance in air,
To wind down our minds with breezes blow,groovy lift's cools us lighter.
Mid mate of months---come and show your primeval splendor and glee---
While south is praising vintager's autumn, north's propitious spring do fly
And make the country lush with garden fruits, more sweetest scent's they spray
To Fill each rose with flavors long, for all the ardent grooms they pray
Come Glitter, glitter lusty rays,and sun is warm in moderate mood.
Behold! the coming of her's, bees gathered among the newly buds.

On An Arctic Winter,"
Cynthia then holiness spread in arctic dews,
From lately month that it pinion'd the living world,
There did swell the mild and greenish meadows,
Winter anew with frozen gold of treasury wild.
Moonlit beam mixed with atmospheres frigid cry,
Earthy sister,wind release'd  and then lightly roam;
Mirth awakes  in  foliages and swing its glory,
Enclasp the misted night the cold,unwilling  fame.
whilst from vales,the fairly streams run copious flow,
And rivers there streaming nigh with half thawing ice,
Awaited season bearing her low steep'd clouds of snow,
Earth rob'd its unpleas'd visage 'gainst the wintery haze
Hazel's yield its wild outpouring charm afar the woods;
Its fragrance wander's from Floral eyes to forest streams,
Dimples the pearly drops, they around yonder dells,
And wets upon the clustery- mossy garden farms.
Numb as time,when cold was lagoons and icy yards,
And for those trees,its leaves went watery slumber,
Life hived round the hearth sides of affirming wards,
Where Winged warmth led all with daring number.

On An Insight On Grecian Spring,"
Blossomed Spring from enchanted year,
Now may long lipped magic weave,
when Fair Persephone's love, unwrap
As thus azur'd flowers's wide appear.
O' wake with the darling season!
where green bosomed earth will pine,
For butterfly wings and cuckoo's flap,
And tame their consort's to the boon.
West wind adrift from Dorian dells,
And bliss as whose ascended harmony ,
Beguiled scent's among posy bands;
With murm'ring delight as they lolls.
And the blue skyward they did stretch;
Seen a train of Oscine's uprise,
Therein they tweets,and slides afield,
To that moss-bloomed wilder couch.
Lo' golden harvest's round many beech,
With sweet-lushest fruits and overjoy,
From clusters of tiny yellow flowers,
With sassafras trees brighten much.
Panting multitudes; bestir!
The enthusiast obeys this clime!
Yet sun with its moderate glance,
And flow'd a narrow brooklet fair.
Cyclamens in her tints of pink,
Bloom'd on the peaks of Meteora,
And lilies sprung from Olympus,
With yellow starlike daisies blink.
Nature has embellish rare as may
Its dew-gemm'd primroses glitter'd up,
To show pride for each budding weed,
Since from skies nought a ray dismay
T'is the ancient sculptured high-land,
Of flowers and long- age heritage;
which decorates fields and plateaus;
The steep mountains of peaceful land.
Woodland sedges outgrowing beneath,
Where Grasshopper's find frisky time,
which keen to that syrupy spring,
As Greece bows the grandeur of Earth.
Look yon paradise;glides Athenian aura
Its well seen beauty as from golden car descent,
Whose spells did charm and bliss those outstretched flora-
Are Inspir'd by winds,with pleasures, too pleasant.
Thence Fair Arcadian pines grown,
Being nursed by some glory mists;
of  argent fumes,the trees they drown
Are such by year's balmy effects.
Life's renewal came and pacey flown
As spark's that roused eager jets,
Those spirits by clear morning grown;
encompasses the extend'd spots.
Yet deep beauty,still more to sooth
To mingled earth we humble lay-
Will,ward off infectious dearth,
And pensive dirge no more to may
Oft when Peace its soft passion glee,
sensible to every birth,triumph-
And smooth revival on pastures see-
Is graced as from a deity nymph.
Glad brooms and blue-bells are they,these-
Ha! Countless violet-color'd fancy weft
Awhile this queering heart once ease
Him,Whose eyes see happy aloft?
Goddess, let lush,laughter this way-
In me thus soft a concord make
From this world’s yelling sway;
Let bursting buds they wake- awake
If duskiness awhile it fade
Aye,there joyous wings shall mature
In me, Spring if then rosy-clad
Sweet reflects this song from my musing lyre.

"
One single rose,"
One single rose
all alone
poised and elegant
ready for the sun
glowing while blossoming
tender while growing
slowly petal's fall
and roses are no more"
Out Among the Big Things,"
Out among the big things -
The mountains and the plains -
An hour ain't important,
Nor are the hour's gains;
The feller in the city
Is hurried night and day,
But out among the big things
He learns the calmer way.
Out among the big things -
The skies that never end -
To lose a day ain't nothin',
The days are here to spend;
So why not give 'em freely,
Enjoyin' as we go?
I somehow can't help thinkin'
The good Lord means life so.
Out among the big things -
The heights that gleam afar -
A feller gets to wonder
What means each distant star;
He may not get an answer,
But somehow, every night
He feels, among the big things,
That everything's all right."
Over The Hill From The Poor-House,"
I, who was always counted, they say,
Rather a bad stick any way,
Splintered all over with dodges and tricks,
Known as ""the worst of the Deacon's six;""
I, the truant, saucy and bold,
The one black sheep in my father's fold,
""Once on a time,"" as the stories say,
Went over the hill on a winter's day--
Over the hill to the poor-house.
Tom could save what twenty could earn;
But givin' was somethin' he ne'er would learn;
Isaac could half o' the Scriptur's speak--
Committed a hundred verses a week;
Never forgot, an' never slipped;
But ""Honor thy father and mother"" he skipped;
So _over the hill to the poor-house._
As for Susan, her heart was kind
An' good--what there was of it, mind;
Nothin' too big, an' nothin' too nice,
Nothin' she wouldn't sacrifice
For one she loved; an' that 'ere one
Was herself, when all was said an' done.
An' Charley an' 'Becca meant well, no doubt,
But any one could pull 'em about;
An' all o' our folks ranked well, you see,
Save one poor fellow, and that was me;
An' when, one dark an' rainy night,
A neighbor's horse went out o' sight,
They hitched on me, as the guilty chap
That carried one end o' the halter-strap.
An' I think, myself, that view of the case
Wasn't altogether out o' place;
My mother denied it, as mothers do,
But I am inclined to believe 'twas true.
Though for me one thing might be said--
That I, as well as the horse, was led;
And the worst of whisky spurred me on,
Or else the deed would have never been done.
But the keenest grief I ever felt
Was when my mother beside me knelt,
An' cried an' prayed, till I melted down,
As I wouldn't for half the horses in town.
I kissed her fondly, then an' there,
An' swore henceforth to be honest and square.
I served my sentence--a bitter pill
Some fellows should take who never will;
And then I decided to go ""out West,""
Concludin' 'twould suit my health the best;
Where, how I prospered, I never could tell,
But Fortune seemed to like we [me] well,
An' somehow every vein I struck
Was always bubblin' over with luck.
An', better than that, I was steady an' true,
An' put my good resolutions through.
But I wrote to a trusty old neighbor, an' said,
""You tell 'em, old fellow, that I am dead,
An' died a Christian; 'twill please 'em more,
Than if I had lived the same as before.""
But when this neighbor he wrote to me,
""Your mother's in the poor-house,"" says he,
I had a resurrection straightway,
An' started for her that very day.
And when I arrived where I was grown,
I took good care that I shouldn't be known;
But I bought the old cottage, through and through,
Of some one Charley had sold it to;
And held back neither work nor gold,
To fix it up as it was of old.
The same big fire-place wide an' high,
Flung up its cinders toward the sky;
The old clock ticked on the corner-shelf--
I wound it an' set it agoin' myself;
An' if every thing wasn't just the same,
Neither I nor money was to blame;
Then--_over the hill to the poor-house!_
One blowin', blusterin' winter's day,
With a team an' cutter I started away;
My fiery nags was as black as coal;
(They some'at resembled the horse I stole);
I hitched, an' entered the poor-house door--
A poor old woman was scrubbin' the floor;
She rose to her feet in great surprise,
And looked, quite startled, into my eyes;
I saw the whole of her trouble's trace
In the lines that marred her dear old face;
""Mother!"" I shouted, ""your sorrows is done!
You're adopted along o' your horse-thief son,
Come _over the hill from the poor-house!""_
She didn't faint; she knelt by my side,
An' thanked the Lord, till I fairly cried.
An' maybe our ride wasn't pleasant an' gay,
An' maybe she wasn't wrapped up that day;
An' maybe our cottage wasn't warm an' bright,
An' maybe it wasn't a pleasant sight,
To see her a-gettin' the evenin's tea,
An' frequently stoppin' and kissin' me;
An' maybe we didn't live happy for years,
In spite of my brothers' and sisters' sneers,
Who often said, as I have heard,
That they wouldn't own a prison-bird;
(Though they're gettin' over that, I guess,
For all of 'em owe me more or less);
But I've learned one thing; an' it cheers a man
In always a-doin' the best he can;
That whether, on the big book, a blot
Gets over a fellow's name or not,
Whenever he does a deed that's white,
It's credited to him fair and right.
An' when you hear the great bugle's notes,
An' the Lord divides his sheep an' goats;
However they may settle my case,
Wherever they may fix my place,
My good old Christian mother, you'll see,
Will be sure to stand right up for me,
With _over the hill from the poor-house._"
Pollution,"
Hazy misty are the mirrors,
That once did shine with glares,
And reflected the images clear,
The same now disfigure the humanity.
The roses that glowed dancingly,
Are dull, yellow colour prevails them all,
They are decaying, fading, withering.
And the trees bend feeling troublesome,
Agonizing pain in their backbones.
The spheres are obscure, dusty,
Ashes blur the face of the Moon,
The earth trembles on emerging,
Appearing, awful erratic incidents,
Which contaminate the blue seas.
The waves rise with the feeble move,
The smoke devours the airs clean,
The awakened eyes are depressed,
And dissuade all on seeing the tragedy,
Being performed on the stage.

Poor flowers in the flower beds of manicured gardens.
They look like they’re afraid of the police…
But they’re so true that they bloom in the same way
And have the same ancient coloring
They had in their wild state for the first gaze of the first man,
Who was startled by the sight of them and touched them lightly
So that he would see them with his fingers too."

Des mains parcheminées et des bébés à naître,
De la femme d’à côté aux regards de princesse.

Des chemins inventés par poètes enivrés,
Des émotions farouches à la larme oubliée.

Des cigales alanguies aux hivers rougeoyants,
De tous nos matins tendres aux gris de tourterelles
Aux couchants miroitants quand le jour bat de l’aile,
Jusqu’à notre heure exquise, quand tu deviens l’amant.

"
Progress,"
Who have killed all the glowworms,
Behind whom we ran to catch,
And they flew like lowering stars,
Scattering lights all around? 
Where have gone the nightingales,
That sang while cherishing the berries,
Their melodies were much sweeter to the mind,
Than the jumbled music of the modern times? 
Where have gone the cooing doves,
And the chirping sparrows that awoke us all,
Before the sunrise they departed to seek,
Their fate in the shape of scattered grain? 
Why the tasseled prime rose blossoms not,
On the other edge of the flowing stream,
Where now stinking substance creeps?
Here were the farms where the children ran,
After the butterflies: the flying, floating dreams.
How seedily numerous homes are built,
And how sooner men came close to men,
In the same so-called community? 
But all suffer and sigh,
Groan and moan individually alone,
No one inquires after the ailing patients,
Tossing unaided on the death beds,
And reluctantly are followed the coffins.

"
Progress ,"
The folk of my village
Have progressed,
They have made the houses,
On the imported designs,
Much more sophisticated
Than the older ones,
Made of mud and stones,
With very low walls,
Over which the neighbourers
Could pass the saucers
To share the meal.
Now motors hum
Through the streets
Where voices of animals
Goats and sheep
Cows, Bulls and buffalos,
Milk being churned were heard. 
Men and women have changed
But the seasons come and go,
On the previous modes,
Spring and Monsoon sojourn
On the meadows
Fragrant grass grow,
Wild trees blossom, dew falls
And rains pour down
To give them wash,
And they sway in the sun
When the wind blows,
But no animal is seen
To graze the green objects,
No shepherd moves around,
With a rotator to twist strands,
Of fiber into the double cord
Spun to weave the cots.
Older women are not seen
With the mowers or scythes,
Or going to the homes, at noon
Bending backs with loads
Of stuffed sacks of green grass,
To feed the awaiting stock at home,
In consequence the nation drinks,
Milk of chemical contents.

"
Quest,"
Give me a cloak, a bow and a horse
To guide me through these lands;
Give me a star, a hope and of course,
A sword to hold in hand!
Whisper my name, O rushing wind,
And tell me where I should go.
Lead me out of this clattering din,
And take me to the tranquil of the woods.
Let me hear the first birds sing
In the rising dawn.
Let me drink the sweet dewdrops
In that pure new morn.
Let me feel the tender grass
Wet beneath my bare feet;
Let me listen to the secrets
The trees say when we meet.
Let me play a cheery tune
And sing a song forgotten;
Let me dance in the light of the moon,
Then travel to lands untrodden.
Now let me ride over vast wide plains,
With my steed so sure and swift -
Let me ride! In sun or rain;
Let me feel my spirits lift.
Let me feel the wind through me,
Let me draw comfort.
Let me laugh as I once did, wild and free,
Clinging onto nothing for support.
The sweet rain falls, hail, my sister!
Wash away the memories of yesterday,
Fall on my parched face, and whisper:
Look only to today.
O gentle wind, what did you say?
Your voice is silent, yet pitying,
And I see now that it is day -
And all was just a dream.
Now I stand beneath the forests' eaves,
And listen to them beckoning to me;
Those dewdrops and those birds and leaves;
But I will let them be.
I look over the untamed plains,
And feel a sting in my heart.
I'll not ride them yet, in shine or rain,
For my destiny dwells apart.
And laughter is but a memory...
And songs are ne'er sung.
Tears are all that tarry,
And today has never begun.
For duty calls me back,
Whenever I step to happiness,
I'm trying to show them what they lack,
And I'll fall when all is done, from weariness.
I will visit the forests and its dark green trees -
I'll ride the open lees.
I will dance by fires and I'll be
Where all would have been lost if it weren't for me.

"
Rain,"
Seeping through the branches a drop slithers and falls,
Free falling; the sky burns and squalls.
It collides with the green leaf and imprints on the ground,
And the smell of the rain hits you harder than the loudest sound.
Countless memories run through the spine to your brain,
Shaking every little piece of you in remembrance.
Whatever it may be, the recollections be good or bad,
The rain copes to upsurge your deepest secrets.
The water bleeds from the top soil to the profound roots,
Does the rain reminds you something old or something new?
The greens applause when the rain touches their body,
Knowing the thirst is over and resuscitation it is.
Too much of something is never good- knows the flood;
Destroying possessions human earned by burning their blood.
Too little of something is neither good- knows the drought;
Not letting the foliage and green bud to sprout.
Drops keep falling until the rivers and seas satiate,
We sit and watch the phenomenon and appreciate-
Its beauty but soon it will be gone; it will slip away,
But another tomorrow the rain will pour again anyway."
Rainbow Hues,"
Crumbled pieces undefined
A splash of colour invisible
Moods of loss and memories destined
Its a rainbow, Its a rainbow
Flowing fabrics woven with words
Wind takes over the game
Oh so beautiful the ugly mind of mine
Its a rainbow, Its a rainbow
Lost in the miseries of the time
Blinded by the passion of the rhyme
Pick up a random lingering thought
Its a rainbow, Its a rainbow
Chuckled at the thought of life
Its a dilemma of the knife
cut or chop, self or memories
Its a rainbow, Its a rainbow
Its a rainbow, black and white
Its a rainbow, invisible light
Its a rainbow so far so near
Its a rainbow, why fear?

"
Reverence,"
Mother! All alone at home, estranged and uncherished,
Forgetful of her love and prayers is her family, causing a conscience anguished;
Comfortably buried are her pursuits to raise and nurture them into the accomplished and established.
Here she is, still silently enduring... with utterly no rebuke
An unwitting husband and discourteous children,
So is our exploits towards Mother Nature - I pray that she summon up the strength to survive the nuke.
Pardon us dear Mother Earth
For calls to preserve you are much underrepresented,
For being unmindful of you, as we are to the real living God -
Our very own Mother whose silent weep is often unattended."
Rhapsody In Pine,"
Rustic curtains bestir back and forth
Panting wind blusters through the open cobwebbed casement
I breathe deep the air sweet
Sylvan pine trees idyllic stir but do not budge
Cool gales bristle through the pines harmoniously in symphony and rhapsody
Composing resonance through its forested ceiling
Rain, soft, falling from above
Makes its journey from pillowed thunderheads above
Trickling off the roof, puddles in soliloquy convey natures speak 
Overhead nature clashes distant in the atmosphere
God Almighty’s footsteps reverberate
Thundering behind majestic granite peaks
From far away awakens me slightly
Traversing between drowsy velveteen thoughts
Reality peeks in and goes, eyelids open slight then close
Heed the fire crackling feigning its last breath
Puffing and heaving its last hint of heat
Shall I rise to stoke these dying flames beckoning?
To feed its hunger for my warmth
Bemoaning to stir myself, yet though, I shall let it slumber, like me

"
Richard Feynman's Woodpecker,"
Under a cloudy sky
A hammering woodpecker
Drilled and drummed
On a tree branch
With her chisel-like bill tip.
Then a physicist stepped out
Of his house into the haze
Billowing over the street.
He scratched his bald head
And brooded and pondered
Contemplated and thought
Of the opaque secret of light.
Well, he said, nowadays
Of course we already know
That light can be
 Both a particle and a wave,
 A stream of arcane photons
Or a recondite river of rays:
Electromagnetic radiation.
But I still
do not understand it,
He muttered,
for this whole damned thing
remains elusive and mysterious.
The problem is, he said,
That while sound waves
Propagate through the air
And surface waves in lakes
Or oceans travel in water,
Light can traverse through
Intergalactic nothing
Moving In straight lines
In the vacuum
Of empty space
Without a medium
As electromagnetic waves.
Now, how does this
Silly light do it?
How can it propagate
Without a medium?
And how does it know
Which way is straight?
And why is it a constant?
He asked, and nothing
Can travel faster
Than the speed of light,
That is to say almost
300,000 km per second.
And he suddenly
Remembered that once
Richard Feynman said:
Physicists do not
Really understand physics,
They just get used to it.
And so the physicist just kept
Wondering and scratching
His bald head
Under a cloudy sky.
A dense gray mist
Billowed then over the street
And a hammering woodpecker
Drilled and drummed
On a tree branch
With her chisel-like bill tip.

what are you doing
flitting idly by?
run home

hide under a tree
or go sleep under the leaves;
have you no sense

Oh run home

the wind blows hard
and you’re being blown around;
what happens if
a tiny hail stone
swings a hole in a wing?
or worse,
oh fragile beauty,
I don’t want to be here to see
a hail stone the size of a child’s fist
land smack on your gentle head
so run home

playful butterfly;

Rural View,"
Frogs croaked
from watery ditches
beside a lazy lane
and cows placidly grazed
in paddocks
beneath a fading sky
tinted pink.
Catatonic crows
snubbed
a cabaret of sparrows
commuting
between arthritic trees
sparsely draped
in mottled leaves.
Lengthening shadows
from the setting sun
spread across
the pale, tinted land
a rich tapestry
in hues
of purple, red and gold.

Salt Creek Falls, Oregon
       (June 19, 2009)
The river’s jaw drops open here,
plunges its swollen 300-foot
tongue to smithereens of thunderous
echo, deluge exploding
deep into dark-brown granite
mottled with phosphorescent moss.
Rain sprinkles my face;
white fins of ghost clouds
slowly glide canyon rims, hover 
moist veils over the mountain shaft,
must be angels, their laughter
silencing the clock,
bringing wind that refreshes,
quenches disquiet
and says Listen to the songs of trout,
long as fir tree roots, see wider than
the rainbow in mist dispelling
dust of doubt, breathe deep as bear. 
I have lost my omnivorous tooth
of desire in a sunbeam peering
through the blue eye between clouds
where a black swift
fledged high beyond the cliff,
swerves, rises to embrace the sky.

Sheep of the Big Horn,"
Come.  Go with me
don't worry
I know where
I'm going
Surely sure-footed
tall and strong
for the heights
Climb high with me
see over the rim
I live in the heights
come go with me
there are places unknown
Never seen, never shown
terrain so steep
No feet can keep
Take in the air
cold crisp
fresh and clean
Wind winding where
ever you step
ever you go
Here - there is a life to be
privileged to know
Come. Go with me.

"
Silent Forest ,"
Today amid the thick forest,
I am here again on the high mound,
The central seat to administer
The cattle left loose around. 
It is the same peak where we all
In the days of my childhood sat,
The reverend shepherds rested
Gossiped about the olden times
Narrated they life long experience,
And some twisted the fibers of jute
On the rotators to make cots. 
Different noises of life gurgled
From all sides around,
The goats bleated, the hounds barked,
The sheep moved lazily after being fed,
The camels ate tassels of the trees
The donkeys brayed at the noon,
The bulls fought entangling horns,
The birds chirped in the shadowy branches. 
Here are the patches where the old women
Of the village came to scythe grass green,
I see my mother too, carrying the stuffed sack,
Going back to home in the long queue. 
At noon the damsels or the elderly ladies
Of the village brought our lunch
With pickle, or onions or sugar
Home baked bread smeared with butter,
And milk in the earthen pots. 
We all excitedly waited for the moment,
Then gentle winds made us all sleepy,
We slept sweet sleep on the bare ground,
While the cattle sat, rested and chewed. 
When evening encroached, we measured
The stretched shadows with our feet
To know the time of return,
And we moved exhausted to homes
Behind the trails of surfeited lazy cattle. 
Ah! It is the same old forest
That often makes me nostalgic,
Melancholic memories begin to assemble
Forcing the tears to drop into dust. 
Sounds of life come from neither side,
The trees stood dressless like ghosts,
Or like bony skeletons that haunt in dreams,
As if flesh of nature has been eaten away
By the callous scavenger modernity. 
Now I being engrossed in the pensive mood
Hear nothing but the dirge of doleful silence
While air passes through stiff dry grass.

"
Socal Storm 2011,"
The ground exceeds saturation.
Owners drain backyard pools 
With rented pumps and hoses.
Dogs growl at raindrops.
Water spouts sighted off Newport.
Coastal roofs prepare for their beating.
Here’s the 3rd storm in a series of 4.
Huntington’s tornado lifted a houseboat.
Wind roars at the windows.
The screens rattle.
Neighborhood chimes ring like xylophones.
Palms and bamboo flutter most—
Leaves excite and shout
Like teenagers at a car wash.
Pines and oaks are mostly stoic;
Arms sway but spines remain
As true as iron.
Disneyland and Knotts threaten to close.
A plastic cup skids over asphalt.
Cats hunker down on blankets.
The mailman delivers mail fast,
Speeds the block like a demon.
The ice cream truck’s on hiatus.
It’s a good day for delivery pizza.
Sparrows dance in weeds and grass,
Rescue most of the drowning.

"
Song,"
Oh! To be a flower
Nodding in the sun,
Bending, then upspringing
As the breezes run;
Holding up
A scent-brimmed cup,
Full of summer's fragrance to the summer sun.
Oh! To be a butterfly
Still, upon a flower,
Winking with its painted wings,
Happy in the hour.
Blossoms hold
Mines of gold
Deep within the farthest heart of each chaliced flower.
Oh! To be a cloud
Blowing through the blue,
Shadowing the mountains,
Rushing loudly through
Valleys deep
Where torrents keep
Always their plunging thunder and their misty arch of blue.
Oh! To be a wave
Splintering on the sand,
Drawing back, but leaving
Lingeringly the land.
Rainbow light
Flashes bright
Telling tales of coral caves half hid in yellow sand.
Soon they die, the flowers;
Insects live a day;
Clouds dissolve in showers;
Only waves at play
Last forever.
Shall endeavor
Make a sea of purpose mightier than we dream to-day?"
Speaking the Language of Deer,"
She heard a thumping sound behind her house,
turned on the back porch light to
a small herd of deer
startled by the suddenness of light, frozen
and indecisive as a letter of regret 
“don’t worry, it’s just me, I won’t harm you,”
she coaxed, a voice in light snowfall,
the deer, transfixed,
disbelieving in all things human
and unnatural
the darkness between, a division, an unsettling
of things beyond light and resolution,
assessing danger on the fly,
hindquarters enveloping into dark
slow as words,
determined as a Quaker weighting options
within the light, in silence
the woman in the household wondered
where they came from, which imaginary forest,
how they survived in the city
without encountering a car, how hooves
might feel on concrete after being in meadows,
why dark was a prevailing wind,
how their eyes remained after they were gone,
how her purse was genuine deerskin
how it fit everything in compartments
like she fit into apartments,
how she could still hear their refusal to stay

Strange Fruit,"
Southern trees bear a strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Black body swinging in the Southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.
Pastoral scene of the gallant South,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolia sweet and fresh,
And the sudden smell of burning flesh!
Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for a tree to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter crop.

Summer,"
This glorious time of year
grace is in bloom, divine
supple spindles gleam
by golden beam
waltz, waltz June fairies
from dandelion to lofty pine.
Off on a stroll above meadows
scented wisps, a tryst, oh my
sandalwood, sweet
fair mulberry treat
swoon, swoon ethereal swans
into the mild, evening light, of July.
Stirring for summer's farewell
frail wonders, tulips, up high
butterflies pair
with delicate flair
steady, steady August delights
primroses await your slumbering sigh.

Sun Light,"
From heavens it descends
in sweat yellowish rays
My mind is blown up by
the beauty it conveys
All look adorable
the trees the parks the highways
And I see the remarkable nature
that sums up the beauty of the night
It's the time of dawn
when we see the sun light
My soul that it takes away
such an astonishing sight
Summer afternoon at it's peak
rain after weak
And the sun shows up
what else do you need.

"
Sunlight Through A Window,"
Beauty streamed into my hand
In sunlight through a pane of glass;
Now at last I understand
Why suns must pass.
I have held a shadow, cool
Reflection of a burning gold,
And it has been more beautiful
Than hands should hold.
To that delicate tracery
Of light, a force my lips must name
In whispers of uncertainty,
Has answered through me in a flame.
Beauty is the core of fire
To reaching hands; even its far
Passing leaves a hurt desire
Like a scar. "
Sunshine Left Behind,"
A band of pale gold
juxtaposed
on an inside wall
reflects the shadows
of flickering leaves
blown by a gentle breeze.
The glow outside
shrouds
shy pumpkin vines
emerging dimly
from the enveloping dark
cossetted inside a twilit sky.

"
The Asparagus,"
She sent packs of great beasts to pass
Over him, trailing belly-fur and dust,
Bending their nostrils to his frail spear.
This was to toughen him. For what?
Stupidly, like a squirrel, standing up,
Looking here and there, looking to all sides,
He is cut down and taken away.
She can smell him steaming, his crowns
Already tender, his spine giving in.
Now he is threatening to wither terribly,
And slip from the water altogether,
And billow through the kitchen like prayer.

"
The Blackbird,"
How sweet the harmonies of afternoon:
The Blackbird sings along the sunny breeze
His ancient song of leaves, and summer boon;
Rich breath of hayfields streams through whispering trees;
And birds of morning trim their bustling wings,
And listen fondly - while the Blackbird sings.
How soft the lovelight of the West reposes
On this green valley's cheery solitude,
On the trim cottage with its screen of roses,
On the gray belfry with its ivy hood,
And murmuring mill-race, and the wheel that flings
Its bubbling freshness - while the Blackbird sings.
The very dial on the village church
Seems as 'twere dreaming in a dozy rest;
The scribbled benches underneath the porch
Bask in the kindly welcome of the West;
But the broad casements of the old Three Kings
Blaze like a furnace - while the Blackbird sings.
And there beneath the immemorial elm
Three rosy revellers round a table sit,
And through gray clouds give laws unto the realm,
Curse good and great, but worship their own wit.
And roar of fights, and fairs, and junketings,
Corn, colts, and curs - the while the Blackbird sings.
Before her home, in her accustomed seat,
The tidy Grandam spins beneath the shade
Of the old honeysuckle, at her feet
The dreaming pug, and purring tabby laid;
To her low chair a little maiden clings,
And spells in silence - while the Blackbird sings.
Sometimes the shadow of a lazy cloud
Breathes o'er the hamlet with its gardens green.
While the far fields with sunlight overflowed
Like golden shores of Fairyland are seen;
Again, the sunshine on the shadow springs,
And fires the thicket where the Blackbird sings.
The woods, the lawn, the peaked Manorhouse,
With its peach-covered walls, and rookery loud,
The trim, quaint garden alleys, screened with boughs.
The lion-headed gates, so grim and proud,
The mossy fountain with its murmurings,
Lie in warm sunshine - while the Blackbird sings.
The ring of silver voices, and the sheen
Of festal garments - and my Lady streams
With her gay court across the garden green;
Some laugh, and dance, some whisper their love-dreams;
And one calls for a little page; he strings
Her lute beside her - while the Blackbird sings.
A little while - and lo! the charm is heard,
A youth, whose life has been all Summer, steals
Forth from the noisy guests around the board,
Creeps by her softly; at her footstool kneels;
And, when she pauses, murmurs tender things
Into her fond ear - while the Blackbird sings.
The smoke-wreaths from the chimneys curl up higher,
And dizzy things of eve begin to float
Upon the light; the breeze begins to tire;
Half way to sunset with a drowsy note
The ancient clock from out the valley swings;
The Grandam nods - and still the Blackbird sings.
Far shouts and laughter from the farmstead peal,
Where the great stack is piling in the sun;
Through narrow gates o'erladen wagons reel,
And barking curs into the tumult run;
While the inconstant wind bears off, and brings
The merry tempest - and the Blackbird sings.
On the high wold the last look of the sun
Burns, like a beacon, over dale and stream;
The shouts have ceased, the laughter and the fun;
The Grandam sleeps, and peaceful be her dream;
Only a hammer on an anvil rings;
The day is dying - still the Blackbird sings.
Now the good Vicar passes from his gate
Serene, with long white hair; and in his eye
Burns the clear spirit that hath conquered Fate,
And felt the wings of immortality;
His heart is thronged with great imaginings,
And tender mercies - while the Blackbird sings.
Down by the brook he bends his steps, and through
A lowly wicket; and at last he stands
Awful beside the bed of one who grew
From boyhood with him - who, with lifted hands
And eyes, seems listening to far welcomings,
And sweeter music than the Blackbird sings.
Two golden stars, like tokens from the Blest,
Strike on his dim orbs from the setting sun;
His sinking hands seem pointing to the West;
He smiles as though he said - 'Thy will be done':
His eyes, they see not those illuminings;
His ears, they hear not what the Blackbird sings."
The Blackbird Of Derrycairn,"
Stop, stop and listen for the bough top
Is whistling and the sun is brighter
Than God's own shadow in the cup now!
Forget the hour-bell. Mournful matins
Will sound, Patric, as well at nightfall.
Faintly through mist of broken water
Fionn heard my melody in Norway.
He found the forest track, he brought back
This beak to gild the branch and tell, there,
Why men must welcome in the daylight.
He loved the breeze that warns the black grouse,
The shouts of gillies in the morning
When packs are counted and the swans cloud
Loch Erne, but more than all those voices
My throat rejoicing from the hawthorn.
In little cells behind a cashel,
Patric, no handbell gives a glad sound.
But knowledge is found among the branches.
Listen! That song that shakes my feathers
Will thong the leather of your satchels."
The calamities,"
Calamities are the beasts of prey,
They hide couching along the route of life,
And pounce on the each passerby,
When he enters into their hunting range,
Who knows who becomes the victim,
And where they prey upon him,
With the nailed paws and tearing jaws.

"
The Chestnut Casts His Flambeaux,"
The chestnut casts his flambeaux, and the flowers
Stream from the hawthorn on the wind away,
The doors clap to, the pane is blind with showers.
Pass me the can, lad; there's an end of May.
There's one spoilt spring to scant our mortal lot,
One season ruined of your little store.
May will be fine next year as like as not:
But ay, but then we shall be twenty-four.
We for a certainty are not the first
Have sat in taverns while the tempest hurled
Their hopeful plans to emptiness, and cursed
Whatever brute and blackguard made the world.
It is in truth iniquity on high
To cheat our sentenced souls of aught they crave,
And mar the merriment as you and I
Fare on our long fool's-errand to the grave.
Iniquity it is; but pass the can.
My lad, no pair of kings our mothers bore;
Our only portion is the estate of man:
We want the moon, but we shall get no more.
If here to-day the cloud of thunder lours
To-morrow it will hie on far behests;
The flesh will grieve on other bones than ours
Soon, and the soul will mourn in other breasts.
The troubles of our proud and angry dust
Are from eternity, and shall not fail.
Bear them we can, and if we can we must.
Shoulder the sky, my lad, and drink your ale."
The Conference of The Birds,"
Now the birds are warming to their task,
Their spirits are moving now like the ocean swell.
Love for the Simurgh is born in those who ask
Themselves if they could tread the path, they tell
Each other they are ready to journey to the light
But first they seek a guide who will lead
And parse anguish and joy throughout their flight.
They swear fidelity to the guide in thought and deed
Be it pleasant or be it filled with pain, as long
As they can pledge themselves to the King, this throng
Of pilgrims dark and fair, are prepared to don
   angels' wings"
The Crossed Apple,"
I've come to give you fruit from out my orchard,
Of wide report.
I have trees there that bear me many apples.
Of every sort:
Clear, streaked; red and russet; green and golden;

Sour and sweet.
This apple's from a tree yet unbeholden,
Where two kinds meet,—
So that this side is red without a dapple,

And this side's hue
Is clear and snowy. It's a lovely apple.
It is for you.
Within are five black pips as big as peas,

As you will find,
Potent to breed you five great apple trees
Of varying kind:
To breed you wood for fire, leaves for shade,

Apples for sauce.
Oh, this is a good apple for a maid,
It is a cross,
Fine on the finer, so the flesh is tight,

And grained like silk.
Sweet Burning gave the red side, and the white
Is Meadow Milk.
Eat it, and you will taste more than the fruit:

The blossom, too,
The sun, the air, the darkness at the root,
The rain, the dew,
The earth we came to, and the time we flee,

The fire and the breast.
I claim the white part, maiden, that's for me.
You take the rest."
The Earth Smiles Back,"
Standing on the rocky shore,
waves crash into the bay,
The sandy beaches glimmer in
the newness of the day.
Wandering the shoreline,
a sound from far away,
The forest echoes with the sound,
of a blackbird or a jay. 
Discovering a tree-lined path,
it seems the perfect day,
To walk a trail I never knew,
and get some time away. 
Breathing in the evergreen,
convinces me to stay,
So I sit a bit to watch
the leaves and branches play. 
Sitting still among the trees,
and all the shades of green,
I smile as I marvel at
these sights I've never seen 
Streams of light shine through just right,
Pillars of sunshine, immensely bright,
I can't be sure but it seems to be,
the earth is smiling back at me.

"
The Earth's Breath,"
The Earth’s Breath is
The kissing reds of rose beds;
Is the blue jay’s lift and curl
In a bush- and sun-spread day;
Is the lake’s changeling face
Turned silver by the moon’s reflection;
Is the soft-caught cedar tree
Aged, flecked with snow.
The Earth’s Breath is
A monument unto itself;
Is ebb and flow and
Life, death, rebirth;
Is both erasure
And remembrance.
The Earth’s Breath is
What makes one ask:
What is the Earth’s Breath?

"
The Epic Menageries ,"
Clouds shape less pleasing,
They’re darkness eclipses
Heaven’s holes to mock the sun;
And the sky gives feeling
Like the world’s going to change
For better or worse;
Their values remain written,
Encrypted in clouds too
Baggy to keep rain;
Choices thunder like hoofs
That beat to sixteen counts
As you listen hard;
So you watch them leave drops
Of rain bits in hazy skies;
While you wait for the
Apocalypse and forget
The world promised to change
For better or naught;
And then you prayed,
And soon you knelt,
When it rained hard and
God then played cards that
They all were dealt;
You went at it again
And kept pounding the waves,
You laughed at the winds
And the trees that fell
As you tried to be brave;
Clouds shape pleasing, they
Drift existentially;
Past eyes held open
Wide for pies and horse’s hoofs
That prick the sky so that
You’ll question your worth.

"
The Glory of Nature,"
IF only once the chariot of the Morn
    Had scatter'd from its wheels the twilight dun,
    But once the unimaginable Sun
Flash'd godlike thro' perennial clouds forlorn,
And shown us Beauty for a moment born;
If only once blind eyes had seen the Spring,
    Waking amid the triumphs of midnoon;
    But once had seen the lovely Summer boon
Pass by in state like a full-robed King,
The waters dance, the woodlands laugh and sing;
If only once deaf ears had heard the joy
    Of the wild birds, or morning breezes blowing,
    Or silver fountains from their caverns flowing,
Or the deep-voiced rivers rolling by;
Then Night eternal fallen from the sky;
If only once weird Time had rent asunder
    The curtain of the Clouds, and shown us Night
    Climbing into the awful Infinite
Those stairs whose steps are worlds, above and under,
Glory on glory, wonder upon wonder!
The Lightnings lit the Earthquake on his way;
    The sovran Thunder spoken to the World;
    The realm-wide banners of the Wind unfurl'd;
Earth-prison'd Fires broke loose into the day;
Or the great Seas awoke -- then slept for aye!
Ah! sure the heart of Man, too strongly tried
    By Godlike Presences so vast and fair,
    Withering with dread, or sick with love's despair,
Had wept for ever, and to Heaven cried,
Or struck with lightnings of delight had died.
But He, though heir of Immortality,
    With mortal dust too feeble for the sight,
    Draws thro' a veil God's overwhelming light;
Use arms the Soul -- anon there moveth by
A more majestic Angel -- and we die! "
The Green Bowl,"
This little bowl is like a mossy pool
In a Spring wood, where dogtooth violets grow
Nodding in chequered sunshine of the trees;
A quiet place, still, with the sound of birds,
Where, though unseen, is heard the endless song
And murmur of the never resting sea.
'T was winter, Roger, when you made this cup,
But coming Spring guided your eager hand
And round the edge you fashioned young green leaves,
A proper chalice made to hold the shy
And little flowers of the woods. And here
They will forget their sad uprooting, lost
In pleasure that this circle of bright leaves
Should be their setting; once more they will dream
They hear winds wandering through lofty trees
And see the sun smiling between the leaves."
The Hawthorn Tree,"
Across the shimmering meadows--
Ah, when he came to me!
In the spring-time,
In the night-time,
In the starlight,
Beneath the hawthorn tree.
Up from the misty marsh-land--
Ah, when he climbed to me!
To my white bower,
To my sweet rest,
To my warm breast,
Beneath the hawthorn tree.
Ask of me what the birds sang,
High in the hawthorn tree;
What the breeze tells,
What the rose smells,
What the stars shine--
Not what he said to me!"
The Little Garden,"
A little garden on a bleak hillside
Where deep the heavy, dazzling mountain snow
Lies far into the spring. The sun's pale glow
Is scarcely able to melt patches wide
About the single rose bush. All denied
Of nature's tender ministries. But no, --
For wonder-working faith has made it blow
With flowers many hued and starry-eyed.
Here sleeps the sun long, idle summer hours;
Here butterflies and bees fare far to rove
Amid the crumpled leaves of poppy flowers;
Here four o'clocks, to the passionate night above
Fling whiffs of perfume, like pale incense showers.
A little garden, loved with a great love!"
The Magic,"
Tell me O gardener, what is this magic
Of branches gloomy and naked yesterday,
Yet bearing magnificent blooms today!
Watch the arms bearing heavenly buds
With petals divine, mystic and vibrant
Being offered to the blues of distant skies!
O gardener, whisper onto my ears deep,
The magic of these majestic blossoms,
To be withered onto the dusty earth!

"
The Merry Guide,"
Once in the wind of morning
I ranged the thymy wold;
The world-wide air was azure
And all the brooks ran gold.
There through the dews beside me
Behold a youth that trod,
With feathered cap on forehead,
And poised a golden rod.
With mien to match the morning
And gay delightful guise
And friendly brows and laughter
He looked me in the eyes.
Oh whence, I asked, and whither?
He smiled and would not say,
And looked at me and beckoned
And laughed and led the way.
And with kind looks and laughter
And nought to say beside
We two went on together,
I and my happy guide.
Across the glittering pastures
And empty upland still
And solitude of shepherds
High in the folded hill,
By hanging woods and hamlets
That gaze through orchards down
On many a windmill turning
And far-discovered town,
With gay regards of promise
And sure unslackened stride
And smiles and nothing spoken
Led on my merry guide.
By blowing realms of woodland
With sunstruck vanes afield
And cloud-led shadows sailing
About the windy weald,
By valley-guarded granges
And silver waters wide,
Content at heart I followed
With my delightful guide.
And like the cloudy shadows
Across the country blown
We two fare on for ever,
But not we two alone.
With the great gale we journey
That breathes from gardens thinned,
Borne in the drift of blossoms
Whose petals throng the wind;
Buoyed on the heaven-heard whisper
Of dancing leaflets whirled
>From all the woods that autumn
Bereaves in all the world.
And midst the fluttering legion
Of all that ever died
I follow, and before us
Goes the delightful guide,
With lips that brim with laughter
But never once respond,
And feet that fly on feathers,
And serpent-circled wand."
The Monster,"
The Beast has come to my neighbourhood again!
The evenings are the most dreadful of times,
A thick smog leaves the tiny village every evening,
It spreads across our shacks like a dirty blanket;
Then each and every one of us comes under His spell!
Some startle, shake and tremble in fear,
Then they start fires in big tins,
Soot, shooting from amber burning coal covers their faces.
They sit around the fire and start to tell ancient tales,
They are all terrified of being found alone.
Not a soul has laid eyes on the Beast!
Those who have, rumour has it, have not been seen again!
It first gives them a mark;
A jelly-like liquid flows from their nostrils: slimy green substance!
Then their throats burn like coal fire; completely under the Dragon’s control.
Some complain of headaches and malaise,
Some have sleepless nights; apnoea has them by the throat.
Ailments are given different names, some get better and some worse;
Those who recover are the lucky ones!
Most are down with Flu, we are told.

"
The Morning Breeze,"
Awake in the light of dawn.
Picking up flower
The heart beats at morning breeze.
The memorable feeling of touch of breeze.
The Krishnachura tree,
Full of red flower
The mind recedes back in the dawn.
The sky is black at eleven o'clock.
The thunder of Kalbaisakhi,
The month of Chaitra (March)
The rain washed thatch.
The sun piercing through the cloud
On the front yard.
The chilled air.
The morning, noon, afternoon moves
To wonderful night.
The soft sun of morning,
The solitude of noon,
The soft smoothness of afternoon,
The fate of seven star.
The koel sings in the dusk
With pain and indifference.
The beautiful music in mp3
Lata, Kishore,
With sadness and anger.

"
The Mountain ,"
Oh mighty fallen Titan,
	once so great,
with ancient purple cheeks
	now cracked by tears,
has fatal time
	so caught thee through the years
		and kept thy backbone
			to this rigid state?
What art thou still?
Thy clutching hands dead weight?
	Each knuckle's rigor mortalness
		yet leers the fear
			that thou art dead.
	Thy scalp appears
		a snowy crown
			now frigid by thy fate.
Yet is there frozen
	in some cavern's yawn
		still blood enough
			of passion's molten flame
		to stir thy sleeping body
			from this trance?
Say this,
	that thou wilt rise
		'gainst what was drawn
	and claim thy throne
	and reign on never tame;
		to take thy stance and
			do thy cosmic dance!

"
The Mountain Crumbles,"

the birth of this mountain
so high seemingly nigh
has always been uncertain
wars on its foothills,floods on its shadows
and many forgotten days went by
 
but the lone mountain stood
like a shade when it eclipsed the sun
stood like a watchtower for the woods
waiting for the river herald on its run
 
 
on nights of the aurora
cold winds await
the seraphims praise
to circle its peak with a magical spell
 
but the lone mountain stood
awaiting its fate to come
on a rainy day this giant faltered
to the last drop of rain it crumbled
 
weathered by a storm
it still bore the lashing of waves below
and the whipping by cold winds above
and screeches of eagles losing their nests
ere to the storm the day of its fall was born
 
millions or raindrops melted its icy exterior
drooped its pinnacle
when soon the mount began to appear bent
whip after whip of wind and rain
 
at dawn when the sun awoke
to its pity found a weathered hill
and a stray drop found its way into the creak that went down the heart of this hill
that as it passed caused the rocks to give way
 
and this is how the mountain crumbled

"
The Mouse,"
When the owl screeches and the wolf howls,
the mouse lies quietly in the field.
Is it the influence of the moon,
a demonstration of anger,
or celebration?
For the mouse cares not
the reason.
His destiny the same,
whether the owl or the wolf,
he fulfills their need."
The Nautical Why,"
The Nautical Why
By cowardice or courage
I came to walk the Cape
of Massachusetts
to rummage feet through dune grasses
and quarrel against tides, tunnel
into the swift corridors of sea
and sand, and slip under the spell
of fragrant beach plums. To get  
to the heart of it: the skeletal truth,
that unglimpsable mystery
which makes sailors leave
the thick yet shrinking land
and battle myths of octopus
and white whales.  I want
to resolve the nautical why—
the question of density,
flotation, and shipbuilding
inside and out. 
I want to know, too, what makes
that great beast of waves and salt
spit back the pine hull
of an antediluvian vessel held
together with wooden pegs
pounded first by hands and later
hammered again by dense
saline fingers. After sleeping
for centuries perhaps, the shipwreck
lands in front of my own storm-tossed eyes
and I witness first hand what sea takes
and what it gives back. Later
passing dunes, I see strewn among
quahogs and crabs, the ribs
of a seal, bone-white and eaten
with the same hull-empty shape
of the shipwreck, the same
twisted scroll that we all leave behind.
In the end we go to sea
for the taking, for the wreck
and its story, for the possibility
of opening the belly of the whale."
The Painted Earth,"
Red of rose and crimson blush of sunset,
blazing ruby ribbons across the sky,
fading dreams of tangerine I'll not forget,
aglow in flames of gold upon my eye.
Sunflowers, daffodils and bumblebees,
In yellow warmth and lemon mellow sun,
and fern-lined pathways green with mossy trees,
in shades of shifting jade as day is spun.
Clouds mingle reflections in sapphire streams,
Cerulean vistas of water and sky,
Fading violet and lilac moonbeams,
Indigo visions in clouds drifting by.
I give my thanks for Nature's work and worth,
with a humble ode to the painted earth.

"
The Passing Cloud,"
T'heres something
over the horizon
its slow its crouching
but rapidly approaching
its dark..and muscular
but nevertheless
spectacular!
it grins...an evil grin
its laughter is loud!
birds in dismay caught in the spin
how evil!!
this handsome cloud
casting a shadow
on his silent spectators
he hovers
and weeps cold showers
he tumbles,and rumbles
sexy..almost
but over a mountain
he stumbles
and as he rolls
he sings a ballad
and now the wind silly,
seems invalid
But my sensual trickster
so cool, so coy
flies over me
its worked!his ploy!
from below
i watch as he departs
the greyness
that lies in his heart.
i look back
theres a murmur
trees,birds,flowers
all begin to stir
But now the sun has come
in all his splendour and shining
soaking 'his' trail,breaking the spell..
and as i see it...a New magic is weaving!!

"
The Peacock,"
What's riches to him
That has made a great peacock
With the pride of his eye?
The wind-beaten, stone-grey,
And desolate Three Rock
Would nourish his whim.
Live he or die
Amid wet rocks and heather,
His ghost will be gay
Adding feather to feather
For the pride of his eye."
The Ragged Wood,"

by William Butler Yeats

O hurry where by water among the trees
The delicate-stepping stag and his lady sigh,
When they have but looked upon their images
Would none had ever loved but you and I!
Or have you heard that sliding silver-shoed
Pale silver-proud queen-woman of the sky,
When the sun looked out of his golden hood?
O that none ever loved but you and I!
O hurty to the ragged wood, for there
I will drive all those lovers out and cry
O my share of the world, O yellow hair!
No one has ever loved but you and I.

"
The Rain Drops,"
The rain drops
That fall into the gutters
Become dirty
That fall into the sea
Get lost
The drops are
Not dirty
Not small
One of that
Its importance
Its power
Sea pride swallows that
In the gutters
It turns dirty drain water
But that point is it
That fall on the flowers,
The flowers blossom
That fall on barren grounds
Become green
Like the garden
That depend
Just to the subjects
Of the nature
And the instinct
How do that accept
The rain drops."
The Rose Tree,"
'O words are lightly spoken,'
Said Pearse to Connolly,
'Maybe a breath of politic words
Has withered our Rose Tree;
Or maybe but a wind that blows
Across the bitter sea.'
'It needs to be but watered,'
James Connolly replied,
'To make the green come out again
And spread on every side,
And shake the blossom from the bud
To be the garden's pride.'
'But where can we draw water,'
Said Pearse to Connolly,
'When all the wells are parched away?
O plain as plain can be
There's nothing but our own red blood
Can make a right Rose Tree.'"
The Seeds of the Red Maple,"
Overnight, the red maple in our backyard,
provider of shade when leaves are full and days
are hot, and of majesty even when bare
in winter, has let go of its seeds, now at
mid summer, in the joy of light and
grief of time taking its inevitable
shape, the season giving in to its own pulse,
the maple's colors soon to turn once again.
The tree's fruit keys * are everywhere, in grass and
shrubs and covering the patio flagstones
and table at which I write this poem, their
strange green casings joined to one another as
if in an eternal kiss, their oddly shaped
wings, whose reticulate filaments emerge
out of a leathery spine, mimicking the
half moon, its glow doing the dark's secret work.
Children, splitting the husks open to find the
sticky pith within (which squirrels love to eat
raised up on haunches, forepaws in a flurry,
their frantic chewing the hint of an autumn
recklessness when winter food must be stored), fix
the wings to their noses so they are marked as
people of the tree, yet other seeds will fly
free, taking their tenacious hold in the soil. "
The Song Of Nature          ,"
If you love me, you love yourself;
If you harm me, you harm yourself;
Thru disasters I've taught:
If I'm not, you're not;
You can't stay cool
If I am hot.
Take out History,
Flip through pages,
I have revolted
Down the ages.
Know me, know yourself,
I'm the master not a slave,
If you don't know
How to behave,
Don't expect me to save.

"
The Spring passing away,"
The river is a river everyday
The bridge everyday is a bridge
The driver, jeep, contractor
All the same …
Why the mind
doesn’t go beyond these?
Looking around that day
I witnessed the trees
Passing away was
the Spring.
Passing over the Kurjan bridge
I saw the sky full of clouds
Expanding was the Ganga
A momentary sparkle of joy
and then –
the same driver
same jeep
same contractor
Even if these all change
Even then season won’t
Trees of Chinar
or Devdar
I don’t recognize
Enter in poetry
enter in mind
the names of
Kashmir, Himalaya
Opposite my home
from Peepal tree
Bird droppings continue
round the clock
The recognition of that tree
is out of poetry
What sort of forgetfulness
I forget many things
Also very lazy I’m
I don’t see even
the vicinage"
The Tempest,"
Silence,
Spread all over,
Before it arrives.
No one,
Has a clue,
Of what is going to happen.
They are busy in their daily chores,
When suddenly,
The waves come crashing by the shore.
The winds become strong,
There's thunder everywhere,
And there's commotion.
People wonder what's happening,
They leave their houses,
And run for shelter.
But, alas!
They are swept by the sea,
Who does not listen to anyone's plea.
Children become orphans,
And parents, homeless,
There is the whirlwind, engulfing almost the whole universe.
A high tide,
That destroys all the dreams,
Of people very easily.
No mercy,
For anyone,
It's God's way of showing anger.
When it subsides,
Everything's wiped off,
Not even a single leaf is left.
The shore is silent again,
People will reside again,
Unaware of God's next plan.

"
The Time,"
I am the time
I don't wait
For no anyone
For no anything
Never back again
It is my nature
The wise people
Use and avail me
For their happy life
For their purposes
For their goals
But the simpleton
They wait for me
And live in the dreams
They waste me
If they awake
They feel sorry
I am not there
Any more
I am the Time
I don't wait
Never back again"
The Tree of Scarlet Berries,"
The rain gullies the garden paths
And tinkles on the broad sides of grass blades.
A tree, at the end of my arm, is hazy with mist.
Even so, I can see that it has red berries,
A scarlet fruit,
Filmed over with moisture.
It seems as though the rain,
Dripping from it,
Should be tinged with colour.
I desire the berries,
But, in the mist, I only scratch my hand on the thorns.
Probably, too, they are bitter."
The Turning Tree,"
This to be beautiful to you
Set against all this you know of
So ominous, set against it,
Overcome, might overcome.
This to be beautiful, beautiful,
Never alone enough with God
Never enough among fountains
This be beautiful Spring blue.
Leaf love you for this the while
I am with you and the while after
This earth I am standing on, the
Herons and smaller birds possess.
This to be beautiful to you
The downward fire I spoke of
The eel grass, the snowy path,
The wide shore, the wide shore.
Speak of it, speak it, unceasing, all
These lines to the tomb, O turning tree,
Set against all this you know of
Overcome, will, overcome.
Grave tree of the dark plowland under,
I will will the whole time to you:
Falling water, wave falling, dew
Dust, horses, spirits, Spirit.

"
The Vision,"
Although
I am not the perfect
But if you come to me
I see your heart first
Then I read your mind
Analysis your face
I focus on your words
I observe your reality
In all characters
In all subjects
At the conclusion
I smile
And say to me;
It is the world
No one is you
Let's leave it
Nature cannot be
The turnout."
The voices of a Leaf,"
I am what I am
Just a lonely leaf on a tree,
Surrounded by so many,
Yet more solitare than any.
I reach out for the sunlight,
But there wasn't enough to share,
I wished I could take flight
To somewhere where others care.
I am just a lonely leaf on a tree,
How I wish mother nature with notice me,
My voice unheard,
Drowned by the noises around,
My song unsung
As I float to the ground.
My end has come
But none seem to care
My life so glum
Its difficult to bare
I lay unnoticed on the ground
with a thousand more scattered around
But while my eyes deceived me,
And what my heart was blind to see,
My true worths form
Hidden within me.
I saw myself insignificant to my tree
Yet the soil beneath her welcomed me,
With open arms and warm sincerity,
She received me with such gentility
Finally at the end, she whispered to me
for then I realised my true destiny
I surrendered myself for My end was served
To benefit all till eternity.

"
The Water-Nymph,"
In lakeside leafy groves, a friar
Escaped all worries; there he passed
His summer days in constant prayer,
Deep studies and eternal fast.
Already with a humble shovel
The elder dug himself a grave -
As, calling saints to bless his hovel,
Death; nothing other; did he crave.
So once, upon a falling night, he
Was bowing by his wilted shack
With meekest prayer to the Almighty.
The grove was turning slowly black;
Above the lake a mist was lifting;
Through milky clouds across the sky
The ruddy moon was softly drifting,
When water drew the friar's eye...
He's looking puzzled, full of trouble,
Of fear he cannot quite explain,
He sees the waves begin to bubble
And suddenly grow calm again.
Then -- white as first snow in the highlands,
Light-footed as nocturnal shade,
There comes ashore, and sits in silence
Upon the bank, a naked maid.
She eyes the monk and brushes gently
Her hair, and water off her arms.
He shakes with fear and looks intently
At her, and at her lovely charms.
With eager hand she waves and beckons,
Nods quickly, smiles as from afar
And shoots, within two flashing seconds,
Into still water like a star.
The glum old man slept not an instant;
All day, not even once he prayed:
Before his eyes still hung and glistened
The wondrous, the relentless shade...
The grove puts on its gown of nightfall;
The moon walks on the cloudy floor;
And there's the maiden; pale, delightful,
Reclining on the spellbound shore.
She looks at him, her hair she brushes,
Blows airy kisses, gestures wild,
Plays with the waves; caresses, splashes -
Now laughs, now whimpers like a child,
Moans tenderly, calls louder, louder...
""Come, monk, come, monk! To me, to me!..""
Then; disappears in limpid water,
And all is silent instantly...
On the third day the zealous hermit
Was sitting by the shore, in love,
Awaiting the delightful mermaid,
As shade was covering the grove...
Dark ceded to the sun's emergence;
Our monk had wholly disappeared -
Before a crowd of local urchins,
While fishing, found his hoary beard.

"
The Waves,"
As the waves
Hit the shore
And enjoy that
Also out of control
And then revert
Let me in my waves
In the same way
I also want to cross
My limits
To extend the limits."
The Way,"
At first a mere thread of a footpath half blotted
out by the grasses
Sweeping triumphant across it, it wound between hedges of roses
Whose blossoms were poised above leaves as pond lilies float on
the water,
While hidden by bloom in a hawthorn a bird filled the morning with
singing.
It widened a highway, majestic, stretching ever
to distant horizons,
Where shadows of tree-branches wavered, vague outlines invaded by
sunshine;
No sound but the wind as it whispered the secrets of earth to the
flowers,
And the hum of the yellow bees, honey-laden and dusty with pollen.
And Summer said, ""Come, follow onward, with no thought save the
longing
to wander,
The wind, and the bees, and the flowers, all singing the great song
of Nature,
Are minstrels of change and of promise, they herald the joy of the
Future.""
Later the solitude vanished, confused and distracted
the road
Where many were seeking and jostling. Left behind were
the trees
and the flowers,
The half-realized beauty of quiet, the sacred unconscious communing.
And now he is come to a river, a line of gray, sullen water,
Not blue and splashing, but dark, rolling somberly on to the ocean.
But on the far side is a city whose windows flame gold in the sunset.
It lies fair and shining before him, a gem set betwixt sky and water,
And spanning the river a bridge, frail promise to longing desire,
Flung by man in his infinite courage, across the stern force of
the water;
And he looks at the river and fears, the bridge is so slight,
yet he ventures
His life to its fragile keeping, if it fails the waves will engulf
him.
O Arches! be strong to uphold him, and bear him across to the city,
The beautiful city whose spires still glow with the fires of sunset!"
The Winding Stairway,"
- solo nijuin renku -
English version by Constantin Severin
out of cherry blossoms
the haru ideogram
appears under the hands of a blind man
          I eye her fixedly through the slot
          between two petals
how she twofolded herself
in springlike
dewy bodies
          the skin gets bizarre
          signs on your street
frozen city
the skaters glide up
the sheen of the moon
          in the park the snowflakes
          only avoid two embers' shadows
the flame of the lighter
amplifies the fluttering
in our lips
          tramways collide against
          large night butterflies
a pair of tweezers
to pluck out of the page fiber
a skull
          nothing more exquisite than
          a silver-bound book
up a birch-tree
the song of the blackbird gathers
the light in sheaves
          a few wheat-ears float
          toward the circle of waterlilies
that round mouth
lurking in the fog
of the squalid railway station
          it takes me only one leaf to touch
          the warm space between her ankles
I touch softly the word
""moon"" in the dictionary
soaked by autumn
          barefoot child circling
          the sparrow-nest that's gone with the wind
winding stairway
the clouds are looming
bodyless wings
          who I wonder has painted
          the stairs leading to my house
under the white girder
the linden tree starts up
a dragon fly
          pair of blind people walking across
          the haru ideogram

"
These Are The Clouds,"
These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
The majesty that shuts his burning eye:
The weak lay hand on what the strong has done,
Till that be tumbled that was lifted high
And discord follow upon unison,
And all things at one common level lie.
And therefore, friend, if your great race were run
And these things came, So much the more thereby
Have you made greatness your companion,
Although it be for children that you sigh:
These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
The majesty that shuts his burning eye."
Thoughts on the Beach at Night,"
Can cells sense something's wrong
	when cancer starts?
The body as a whole
	is self-contained,
	complete,
	compatible in all its parts.
	Its function, features, fate
	are all maintained.
What is this maverick madness,
	counter-fate,
	a tyrant spirit
	rending all awry
	to sap and warp,
	confound and mutilate,
	a manic mayhem
	forced to multiply?
What kind of baneful guest
	is so engrossed
	within the selfish meeting
		of his needs
	to damn his future,
	jeopardize his host?
Now everything that eats
	and shits and breeds,
	the very stars and waves,
	and wind and sand,
		must dread our gaze,
		the moving of a hand.

"
Through a spider's web,"
It was a mid summer evening
And I lay below the old wood
Looking at a spider nearby spinning
It's delicate web, a silent art so good
Through the spider's web
I saw a different world
Felt the relative tide and ebb
Along the natural beauty curled
It looked like a magic window
An entrance of a start, a door
I lay enchanted and felt the wind blow
Brushing through my mind like an ancient lore
Oh! Such beauty and grace
I watches as the spider swayed
Living in it's own imaginative daze
Floating so smoothly in thin air
Beside me, I could hear the running stream
And it seemed like a rhythm to the spider
To work so perfectly, lost in it's dream
And slowly, my heart felt lighter and lighter...

"
Tip tap RAIN,"
And I too became wet in that tip tap rain
When in summer I got the company of rain
Which brought with it the tip tap grain .
On plants it rained in such a way
That all buds  became gay .
The neem tree in front of my window
Which has gone leafless
That too smiled
Like it got new life  so fresh.
The flower of marigold has decorated itself too
And it took me in its  beautiful hue .
It seemed like walls of my home
Too has welcomed it
And introduced its each part to it  .
And in this I was unable to stop my inner shout
People tried but  i just galloped   out  .
And I too become wet in that tip tap rain  ...

To Her Beauty,"
If 'beauty' Be the self satisfied pride she bears,Each Fly do wing around her cherubic sweet face,As they; lovers seek what her anonymous covers,And dream them in a transient trace.When 'beauty', a self possessed pride, you Worn,Each fly does wing around your wilt grace,As what lovers opine, 'how your beauty haste flown;As falls the man in his transient race'.

"
To The Rose Upon The Rood Of Time,"
Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days!
Come near me, while I sing the ancient ways:
Cuchulain battling with the bitter tide;
The Druid, grey, wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed,
Who cast round Fergus dreams, and ruin untold;
And thine own sadness, where of stars, grown old
In dancing silver-sandalled on the sea,
Sing in their high and lonely melody.
Come near, that no more blinded hy man's fate,
I find under the boughs of love and hate,
In all poor foolish things that live a day,
Eternal beauty wandering on her way.
Come near, come near, come near; Ah, leave me still
A little space for the rose-breath to fill!
Lest I no more bear common things that crave;
The weak worm hiding down in its small cave,
The field-mouse running by me in the grass,
And heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass;
But seek alone to hear the strange things said
By God to the bright hearts of those long dead,
And learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know.
Come near; I would, before my time to go,
Sing of old Eire and the ancient ways:
Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days."
Trails of Beauty,"
Trails of beauty fades out much strife
A harmony that runs through all life
We sit together, the mountain and I
Hours upon hours a soothing lullaby
To dive in with beauty before me flares
Profound sense of joy, serenity & glares
A creation, of natural treasures wonder
Stubble-plains with rosy hue; I see afar
The songs of spring echoing Summer
Majestic mountain, peaceful waters flow
Gentle breeze blowing gracefully with awe
This dreamy life, carried by nature's stride
Is one where you go to feel  & reach inside"
Tranquility,"
Disturbed by nonsense,
Every day is so monotonous.
There's no uniqueness,
Each day is like an illness.
It never gets cured,
Unless there's change.
There's no peace,
There's no feast.
The whole day,
I just think of something new,
I eagerly wait for something that has never happened before,
Something that'll make me ask my life for more.
I wandered once,
Like a vagabond.
I had no clue of where I was going,
No idea of what I was doing.
Suddenly, I spotted a lake,
Surrounded by shrubs.
I could hear the silence,
It was a never-seen-before experience.
I never felt so glad ever before,
I never felt I had the time,
But, once when I was with Nature,
Everything changed forever.
The birds chirping,
I could hear it clearly,
I felt heavenly,
It seemed as if God had landed on the Earth, actually.
I never felt like leaving the place,
It was so serene,
So quiet,
So blissful.
I could see my inner self,
Come alive slowly,
Not everyone is that fateful,
To be so close to tranquility.

"
Tree of Hope,"
It stood there
-and the distant fires of passion
Were ghastly dancing around it-
the old tree.
They called it a whisperer in the fog.
A confessional, the believers called it,
Who never found the warmth of the old tree
In the cold chest of the stone buildings,
And every passer-by could consider it a friend
In the dim illumination.
And today, in the crack of dawn
Of the new millennium, the old tree was cut,
Treacherously thorn from the hands of believers,
A scream on earth’s thirsty lips,
The scream of the entire exhausted world.
Drowning  this moment, this hour,
Or an eternity.
Because it is worn by the cold wind’s of greed
Entwining it, touching it with a thousand lips
Clinging against the face of the diseased world.
The tree of hope is no longer here
For us to nail the mirror of conscience into it,
To see the reflection in it
Of whatever is left of the diseased world,
Just a skeleton in a warm black wave of sensual oblivion
A dream-lit slumber without dreams,
In which the entire diseased world was drowning.
The warm veil of passion fell onto the face of the world
And the tree of hope became a hopeless coffin."
Two Stranger Birds in Our Feathers,"
My sky is ashen. Scratch my back. And undo
slowly, you stranger, my braids. And tell me
what's on your mind. Tell me what crossed
Youssef's mind. Tell me some simple
talk . . . talk a woman always desires
to be told. I don't want the phrase
complete. Gesture is enough to scatter me in the rise
of butterflies between springheads and the sun. Tell me
I am necessary for you like sleep, and not like nature
filling up with water around you and me. And spread
over me an endless blue wing . . .
My sky is ashen,
as a blackboard is ashen, before
writing on it. So write with my blood's ink anything
that changes it: an utterance . . . two, without
excessive aim at metaphor. And say we are
two stranger birds in Egypt
and in Syria. Say we are two stranger birds
in our feathers. And write my name and yours
beneath the phrase. What time is it now? What color
is my face and yours in new mirrors?
I own nothing for anything to resemble me.
Did the water mistress love you more? Did she seduce you
by the sea rock? Confess now
that you have extended your wilderness twenty years
to stay prisoner in her hands. And tell me
what you think of when the sky is ashen . . .
My sky is ashen.
I resemble what no longer resembles me.
Do you want to return to your exile night
in a mermaid's hair? Or do you want to return
to your home figs? For no honey wounds a stranger
here or there? So what time is it now?
What's the name of this place we're in? And
what's the difference between my sky and your land. Tell me
what Adam said in secret to himself. Was he emancipated
when he remembered. Tell me anything that changes the sky's
ashen color. Tell me some simple
talk, talk a woman desires
to be told every now and then. Say
that two people, like you and me,
can carry all this resemblance between fog
and mirage, then safely return. My sky
is ashen, so what do you think of when the sky
is ashen?"

"
Unsaid,"
Little wisps of grass
stood above the snow.
Like hairs pricked by static.
Defiant, but folding over
from the weight.
Like a harsh tongue
rolling over the wash of words
left unsaid.

Using Each Other,"
The natural seasons
The spring, summer
Autumn, winter
The terms of seasons
Love, affection, friendship
Birth and death
And further
As the natural instinct
That continues
Within its system
Philosophy, and mysterious,
The description is that
Every subject or term
And everyone
Depend on each other,
Using each other"
Watercolour Words,"
Distant forests
solemnly levitate
through wispy mists
with fluttering leaves
disconcerted
by a teasing breeze
and ancient trees
that benignly sway
towards rippling reflections
dancing with water-lilies.

"
Weeds,"
The grass is green
but not as bright
as those little devils
that work at night.
From spidery roots
that remain unseen
a surprise lurks
for those with a thumb of green.
They can be poisoned
pulled, and cut
yet are never satisfied
to stay in the rut.
Even without earth laid bare
can find a stone
seek a crack
and make a home.  "
What I Need,"
I need fresh air to breathe,
All around sullied is the environ,
And seasons do not unfold flowers.
Thousands of birds soar in the sky,
But have no place to be nestled,
A ray of light is needed to lacerate
The encompassing night
And mist of depression to dissolve.
The mirrors are dim murky,
And they hinder me in self recognition.

When I live with fancy',"
'while this fancy a stretched art,
When cheers, her beeps long they live ,
when from secret eyes so well dart,
To scan in peace and solemn strive.
Like Caring wings of zephyr's drift and blow,
As wet streams they run so widest and rush,
She from tents of flora, mind's lonely flow,
With her wings of strongest and lofty wish.
Gaining is solitude with climbing those skies,
Not far from my arts, but live in her heart,
Which the ripples that form in motive eyes,
By nature I live and die, fancy's smart!

Whisper In The Wind ,"
the wind carries a voice in waves of sound
bouncing off all it touches
it flows through the trees and over the blades of grass
it tickles the flower petals and shakes the bee
it shimmers the leaves and turns the dew drops into a dance 
there are words from the voice
words of volume and words of song
words to inspire and words to harm
sounds that will sooth and console and heal
sounds that can hurt and scare and devastate
waves of sound that enter the ear and tingle the brain 
yet gentle waves from a tiny voice so soft and pure
small ripples that lightly wash on shore
barely disturbing the sand
this is the voice we long to hear, the voice that calms the soul
this is the angelic music that makes us whole
the whisper in the wind
the sounds that we hum and ones we remember and repeat
listen for these sounds
request these sounds
cherish these sounds

"
Wind,"
in the fall it wafts leaves,
hiding tiny fairies
dancing on each
as in celebration
of freedom from trees bondage
in the winter snow
cold and unremorseful
hide beauty
seen
only by those who dare transition
to find her hidden secrets
in the summer
it is wispy
as if entranced by happiness
entering through my window
it feels like an old friend
touching me softly
reassuring night or day
it surrounds all the beauty of nature
making nary a sound
when there is peace
and contentment in her swishing, swirling
natural world
occasionally,
demonstrates a fierce side
as in anger,
supports her friends thunder and lightning
raising her winds from mild to destructive
in answering her mother’s call
wind at the mercy of the element’s
of which she is made

"
Wind,"
He shouts in the sails of the ships at sea,
He steals the down from the honeybee,
He makes the forest trees rustle and sing,
He twirls my kite till it breaks its string.
Laughing, dancing, sunny wind,
Whistling, howling, rainy wind,
North, South, East and West,
Each is the wind I like the best.
He calls up the fog and hides the hills,
He whirls the wings of the great windmills,
The weathercocks love him and turn to discover
His whereabouts -- but he's gone, the rover!
Laughing, dancing, sunny wind,
Whistling, howling, rainy wind,
North, South, East and West,
Each is the wind I like the best.
The pine trees toss him their cones with glee,
The flowers bend low in courtesy,
Each wave flings up a shower of pearls,
The flag in front of the school unfurls.
Laughing, dancing, sunny wind,
Whistling, howling, rainy wind,
North, South, East and West,
Each is the wind I like the best."
Winter's End,"
Every year in early spring
upon the prairie
nature displays an orchestration
of color and fragrance
engulfing the senses
proclaiming the glory of life;
a banquet hailing winter's end
laid as a feast in celebration
of renewal

Winter's Fall,"
With the backdoor hue turning mist, The day does lend a true sad wish The clouds up gather for a final song Thunders last break! ding n dong! Nature's up with beauty it can Sharing its glow, with the river it ran Through the tress that shed leaves to dry Sheds my tears with smile to cry! Moon above me, glows with tempt and smile Snowflakes to share from clouds that cry Lighting up woods with times to pause Sending up stars, the deers n claus! Swooping notes now change low Wind gushing in parts ever known Casting a smile not known to last Catching air, till last moments may last! The rain up now, dares to break Would nature please to break? Glooming thoughts grew a waterfall Praying the skies for a water to fall. Creepy to lock eyes with night Still chanting names of nature's might Whose stars may shine on graves to last Whose glow may show the eternal past. With leaves that shed my tears-to-day For this leaves the night today well, it may gather my heart the all For this moment marks winter's fall.

yugantameghaha: climate change,"
At the end of every cosmic cycle,
at the end of a generation – yuganta-
meghaha¬ – clouds congregate
gathering souls for the next yuga
cloud breath, soul mist
rasping winds, rattling bones
here come the galloping horses
humans astride their flanks
here come the thundering clouds,
breaking the world apart
the Hercules moth climbs every building
rising upwards through 110 floors
scaling the earth to find the moon
that light in the sky through which
he might escape earth’s pull
and melt into the inferno of light.
yugantameghaha is a Sanskrit word meaning a gathering of clouds at the end of an epoch; a yuga is an epoch and some say we are currently living in the Kali yuga, an epoch of destruction.
