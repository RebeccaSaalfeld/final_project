there is a thing in me that dreamed of trees
a quiet house some green and modest acres
a little way from every troubling town
a little way from factories schools laments
i would have time i thought and time to spare
with only streams and birds for company
to build out of my life a few wild stanzas
and then it came to me that so was death
a little way away from everywhere
there is a thing in me still dreams of trees
but let it go homesick for moderation
half the world s artists shrink or fall away
if any find solution let him tell it
meanwhile i bend my heart toward lamentation
where as the times implore our true involvement
the blades of every crisis point the way
i would it were not so but so it is
who ever made music of a mild day
she sends me news of blue jays frost
of stars and now the harvest moon
that rides above the stricken hills
lightly she speaks of cold of pain
and lists what is already lost
here where my life seems hard and slow
i read of glowing melons piled
beside the door and baskets filled
with fennel rosemary and dill
while all she could not gather in
or hid in leaves grow black and falls
here where my life seems hard and strange
i read her wild excitement when
stars climb frost comes and blue jays sing
the broken year will make no change
upon her wise and whirling heart
she knows how people always plan
to live their lives and never do
she will not tell me if she cries
i touch the crosses by her name
i fold the pages as i rise
and tip the envelope from which
drift scraps of borage woodbine rue
she steps into the dark swamp
where the long wait ends
the secret slippery package
drops to the weeds
she leans her long neck and tongues it
between breaths slack with exhaustion
and after a while it rises and becomes a creature
like her but much smaller
so now there are two and they walk together
like a dream under the trees
in early june at the edge of a field
thick with pink and yellow flowers
i meet them
i can only stare
she is the most beautiful woman
i have ever seen
her child leaps among the flowers
the blue of the sky falls over me
like silk the flowers burn and i want
to live my life all over again to begin again
to be utterly
wild
my father for example
who was young once
and blue eyed
returns
on the darkest of nights
to the porch and knocks
wildly at the door
and if i answer
i must be prepared
for his waxy face
for his lower lip
swollen with bitterness
and so for a long time
i did not answer
but slept fitfully
between his hours of rapping
but finally there came the night
when i rose out of my sheets
and stumbled down the hall
the door fell open
and i knew i was saved
and could bear him
pathetic and hollow
with even the least of his dreams
frozen inside him
and the meanness gone
and i greeted him and asked him
into the house
and lit the lamp
and looked into his blank eyes
in which at last
i saw what a child must love
i saw what love might have done
had we loved in time
closing the book i find i have left my head
inside it is dark in here but the chapters open
their beautiful spaces and give a rustling sound
words adjusting themselves to their meaning
long passages open at successive pages an echo
continuous from the title onward hums
behind me from in here the world looms
a jungle redeemed by these linked sentences
carved out when an author traveled and a reader
kept the way open when this book ends
i will pull it inside out like a sock
and throw it back in the library but the rumor
of it will haunt all that follows in my life
a candleflame in tibet leans when i move
at blackwater pond the tossed waters have settled
after a night of rain
i dip my cupped hands i drink
a long time it tastes
like stone leaves fire it falls cold
into my body waking the bones i hear them
deep inside me whispering
oh what is that beautiful thing
that just happened
at great pond
the sun rising
scrapes his orange breast
on the thick pines
and down tumble
a few orange feathers into
the dark water
on the far shore
a white bird is standing
like a white candle
or a man in the distance
in the clasp of some meditation
while all around me the lilies
are breaking open again
from the black cave
of the night
later i will consider
what i have seen
what it could signify
what words of adoration i might
make of it and to do this
i will go indoors to my desk
i will sit in my chair
i will look back
into the lost morning
in which i am moving now
like a swimmer
so smoothly
so peacefully
i am almost the lily
almost the bird vanishing over the water
on its sleeves of night
when the blackberries hang
swollen in the woods in the brambles
nobody owns i spend
all day among the high
branches reaching
my ripped arms thinking
of nothing cramming
the black honey of summer
into my mouth all day my body
accepts what it is in the dark
creeks that run by there is
this thick paw of my life darting among
the black bells the leaves there is
this happy tongue
needing one i invented her
the great great aunt dark as hickory
called shining leaf or drifting cloud
or the beauty of the night
dear aunt i d call into the leaves
and she d rise up like an old log in a pool
and whisper in a language only the two of us knew
the word that meant follow
and we d travel
cheerful as birds
out of the dusty town and into the trees
where she would change us both into something quicker
two foxes with black feet
two snakes green as ribbons
two shimmering fish and all day we d travel
at day s end she d leave me back at my own door
with the rest of my family
who were kind but solid as wood
and rarely wandered while she
old twist of feathers and birch bark
would walk in circles wide as rain and then
float back
scattering the rags of twilight
on fluttering moth wings
or she d slouch from the barn like a gray opossum
or she d hang in the milky moonlight
burning like a medallion
this bone dream this friend i had to have
this old woman made out of leaves
over the local stations one by one
announcers list disasters like dark poems
that always happen in the skull of winter
but once again the storm has passed us by
lovely and moderate the snow lies down
while shouting children hurry back to play
and scarved and smiling citizens once more
sweep down their easy paths of pride and welcome
and what else might we do les us be truthful
two counties north the storm has taken lives
two counties north to us is far away
a land of trees a wing upon a map
a wild place never visited so we
forget with ease each far mortality
peacefully from our frozen yards we watch
our children running on the mild white hills
this is the landscape that we understand
and till the principle of things takes root
how shall examples move us from our calm
i do not say that is not a fault
i only say except as we have loved
all news arrives as from a distant land
okay not one can write a symphony or a dictionary
or even a letter to an old friend full of remembrance
and comfort
not one can manage a single sound though the blue jays
carp and whistle all day in the branches without
the push of the wind
but to tell the truth after a while i m pale with longing
for their thick bodies ruckled with lichen
and you can t keep me from the woods from the tonnage
of their shoulders and their shining green hair
today is a day like any other twenty four hours a
little sunshine a little rain
listen says ambition nervously shifting her weight from
one boot to another why don t you get going
for there i am in the mossy shadows under the trees
and to tell the truth i don t want to let go of the wrists
of idleness i don t want to sell my life for money
i don t even want to come in out of the rain
in april
the ponds open
like black blossoms
the moon
swims in every one
there s fire
everywhere frogs shouting
their desire
their satisfaction what
we know that time
chops at us all like an iron
hoe that death
is a state of paralysis what
we long for joy
before death nights
in the swale everything else
can wait but not
this thrust
from the root
of the body what
we know we are more
than blood we are more
than our hunger and yet
we belong
to the moon and when the ponds
open when the burning
begins the most
thoughtful among us dreams
of hurrying down
into the black petals
into the fire
into the night where time lies shattered
into the body of another
i go down to the edge of the sea
how everything shines in the morning light
the cusp of the whelk
the broken cupboard of the clam
the opened blue mussels
moon snails pale pink and barnacle scarred
and nothing at all whole or shut but tattered split
dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone
it s like a schoolhouse
of little words
thousands of words
first you figure out what each one means by itself
the jingle the periwinkle the scallop
full of moonlight
then you begin slowly to read the whole story
he picks his pond and the soft thicket of his world
he bids his lady come and she does
flirting with her tail
he begins early and makes up his song as he goes
he does not enter a house at night or when it rains
he is not afraid of the wind though he is cautious
he watches the snake that stripe of black fire
until it flows away
he watches the hawk with her sharpest shins aloft
in the high tree
he keeps his prayer under his tongue
in his whole life he has never missed the rising of the sun
he dislikes snow
but a few raisins give him the greatest delight
he sits in the forelock of the lilac or he struts
in its shadow
he is neither the rare plover or the brilliant bunting
but as common as the grass
his black cap gives him a jaunty look for which
we humans have learned to tilt our caps in envy
when he is not singing he is listening
neither have i ever seen him with his eyes closed
though he may be looking at nothing more than a cloud
it brings to his mind several dozen new remarks
from one branch to another or across the path
he dazzles with flight
since i see him every morning i have rewarded myself
the pleasure of thinking that he knows me
yet never once has he answered my nod
he seems in fact to find in me a kind of humor
i am so vast uncertain and strange
i am the one who comes and goes
and who knows why
will i ever understand him
certainly he will never understand me or the world
i come from
for he will never sing for the kingdom of dollars
for he will never grow pockets in his gray wings
three miles through the woods
clapp s pond sprawls stone gray
among oaks and pines
the late winter fields
where a pheasant blazes up
lifting his yellow legs
under bronze feathers opening
bronze wings
and one doe dimpling the ground as she touches
its dampness sharply flares
out of the brush and gallops away
by evening rain
it pours down from the black clouds
lashes over the roof the last
acorns spray over the porch i toss
one then two more
logs on the fire
how sometimes everything
closes up a painted fan landscapes and moments
flowing together until the sense of distance
say between clapp s pond and me
vanishes edges slide together
like the feathers of a wing everything
touches everything
later lying half asleep under
the blankets i watch
while the doe glittering with rain steps
under the wet slabs of the pines stretches
her long neck down to drink
from the pond
three miles away
we enter
the green river
heron harbor
mud basin lined
with snagheaps where turtles
sun themselves we push
through the falling
silky weight
striped warm and cold
bounding down
through the black flanks
of wet rocks we wade
under hemlock
and white pine climb
stone steps into
the timeless castles
of emerald eddies
swirls channels
cold as ice tumbling
out of a white flow
sheer sheets
flying off rocks
frivolous and lustrous
skirting the secret pools
cradles
full of the yellow hair
of last year s leaves
where grizzled fish
hang halfway down
like tarnished swords
while around them
fingerlings sparkle
and descend
nails of light
in the loose
racing waters
cold now
close to the edge almost
unbearable clouds
bunch up and boil down
from the north of the white bear
this tree splitting morning
i dream of his fat tracks
the lifesaving suet
i think of summer with its luminous fruit
blossoms rounding to berries leaves
handfuls of grain
maybe what cold is is the time
we measure the love we have always had secretly
for our own bones the hard knife edged love
for the warm river of the i beyond all else maybe
that is what it means the beauty
of the blue shark cruising toward the tumbling seals
in the season of snow
in the immeasurable cold
we grow cruel but honest we keep
ourselves alive
if we can taking one after another
the necessary bodies of others the many
crushed red flowers
it is possible i suppose that sometime
we will learn everything
there is to learn what the world is for example
and what it means i think this as i am crossing
from one field to another in summer and the
mockingbird is mocking me as one who either
knows enough already or knows enough to be
perfectly content not knowing song being born
of quest he knows this he must turn silent
were he suddenly assaulted with answers instead
oh hear his wild caustic tender warbling ceaselessly
unanswered at my feet the white petalled daisies display
the small suns of their center piece their if you don t
mind my saying so their hearts of course
i could be wrong perhaps their hearts are pale and
narrow and hidden in the roots what do i know
but this it is heaven itself to take what is given
to see what is plain what the sun lights up willingly
for example i think this
as i reach down not to pick but merely to touch
the suitability of the field for the daisies and the
daisies for the field
some kind of relaxed and beautiful thing
kept flickering in with the tide
and looking around
black as a fisherman s boot
with a white belly
if you asked for a picture i would have to draw a smile
under the perfectly round eyes and above the chin
which was rough
as a thousand sharpened nails
and you know
what a smile means
don t you
i wanted the past to go away i wanted
to leave it like another country i wanted
my life to close and open
like a hinge like a wing like the part of the song
where it falls
down over the rocks an explosion a discovery
i wanted
to hurry into the work of my life i wanted to know
whoever i was i was
alive
for a little while
it was evening and no longer summer
three small fish i don t know what they were
huddled in the highest ripples
as it came swimming in again effortless the whole body
one gesture one black sleeve
that could fit easily around
the bodies of three small fish
also i wanted
to be able to love and we all know
how that one goes
don t we
slowly
the dogfish tore open the soft basins of water
you don t want to hear the story
of my life and anyway
i don t want to tell it i want to listen
to the enormous waterfalls of the sun
and anyway it s the same old story
a few people just trying
one way or another
to survive
mostly i want to be kind
and nobody of course is kind
or mean
for a simple reason
and nobody gets out of it having to
swim through the fires to stay in
this world
and look look look i think those little fish
better wake up and dash themselves away
from the hopeless future that is
bulging toward them
and probably
if they don t waste time
looking for an easier world
they can do it
where the path closed
down and over
through the scumbled leaves
fallen branches
through the knotted catbrier
i kept going finally
i could not
save my arms
from thorns soon
the mosquitoes
smelled me hot
and wounded and came
wheeling and whining
and that s how i came
to the edge of the pond
black and empty
except for a spindle
of bleached reeds
at the far shore
which as i looked
wrinkled suddenly
into three egrets
a shower
of white fire
even half asleep they had
such faith in the world
that had made them
tilting through the water
unruffled sure
by the laws
of their faith not logic
they opened their wings
softly and stepped
over every dark thing
another year gone leaving everywhere
its rich spiced residues vines leaves
the uneaten fruits crumbling damply
in the shadows unmattering back
from the particular island
of this summer this now that now is nowhere
except underfoot moldering
in that black subterranean castle
of unobservable mysteries roots and sealed seeds
and the wanderings of water this
i try to remember when time s measure
painfully chafes for instance when autumn
flares out at the last boisterous and like us longing
to stay how everything lives shifting
from one bright vision to another forever
in these momentary pastures
welcome to the silly comforting poem
it is not the sunrise
which is a red rinse
which is flaring all over the eastern sky
it is not the rain falling out of the purse of god
it is not the blue helmet of the sky afterward
or the trees or the beetle burrowing into the earth
it is not the mockingbird who in his own cadence
will go on sizzling and clapping
from the branches of the catalpa that are thick with blossoms
that are billowing and shining
that are shaking in the wind
you still recall sometimes the old barn on your
great grandfather s farm a place you visited once
and went into all alone while the grownups sat and
talked in the house
it was empty or almost wisps of hay covered the floor
and some wasps sang at the windows and maybe there was
a strange fluttering bird high above disturbed hoo ing
a little and staring down from a messy ledge with wild
binocular eyes
mostly though it smelled of milk and the patience of
animals the give offs of the body were still in the air
a vague ammonia not unpleasant
mostly though it was restful and secret the roof high
up and arched the boards unpainted and plain
you could have stayed there forever a small child in a corner
on the last raft of hay dazzled by so much space that seemed
empty but wasn t
then you still remember you felt the rap of hunger it was
noon and you turned from that twilight dream and hurried back
to the house where the table was set where an uncle patted you
on the shoulder for welcome and there was your place at the table
nothing lasts
there is a graveyard where everything i am talking about is
now
i stood there once on the green grass scattering flowers
nothing is so delicate or so finely hinged as the wings
of the green moth
against the lantern
against its heat
against the beak of the crow
in the early morning
yet the moth has trim and feistiness and not a drop
of self pity
not in this world
my mother
was the blue wisteria
my mother
was the mossy stream out behind the house
my mother alas alas
did not always love her life
heavier than iron it was
as she carried it in her arms from room to room
oh unforgettable
i bury her
in a box
in the earth
and turn away
my father
was a demon of frustrated dreams
was a breaker of trust
was a poor thin boy with bad luck
he followed god there being no one else
he could talk to
he swaggered before god there being no one else
who would listen
listen
this was his life
i bury it in the earth
i sweep the closets
i leave the house
i mention them now
i will not mention them again
it is not lack of love
nor lack of sorrow
but the iron thing they carried i will not carry
i give them one two three four the kiss of courtesy
of sweet thanks
of anger of good luck in the deep earth
may they sleep well may they soften
but i will not give them the kiss of complicity
i will not give them the responsibility for my life
did you know that the ant has a tongue
with which to gather in all that it can
of sweetness
did you know that
the poem is not the world
it isn t even the first page of the world
but the poem wants to flower like a flower
it knows that much
it wants to open itself
like the door of a little temple
so that you might step inside and be cooled and refreshed
and less yourself than part of everything
the voice of the child crying out of the mouth of the
grown woman
is a misery and a disappointment
the voice of the child howling out of the tall bearded
muscular man
is a misery and a terror
therefore tell me
what will engage you
what will open the dark fields of your mind
like a lover
at first touching
anyway
there was no barn
no child in the barn
no uncle no table no kitchen
only a long lovely field full of bobolinks
when loneliness comes stalking go into the fields consider
the orderliness of the world notice
something you have never noticed before
like the tambourine sound of the snow cricket
whose pale green body is no longer than your thumb
stare hard at the hummingbird in the summer rain
shaking the water sparks from its wings
let grief be your sister she will whether or no
rise up from the stump of sorrow and be green also
like the diligent leaves
a lifetime isn t long enough for the beauty of this world
and the responsibilities of your life
scatter your flowers over the graves and walk away
be good natured and untidy in your exuberance
in the glare of your mind be modest
and beholden to what is tactile and thrilling
live with the beetle and the wind
this is the dark bread of the poem
this is the dark and nourishing bread of the poem
i am watching the white gannets
blaze down into the water
with the power of blunt spears
and a stunning accuracy
even though the sea is riled and boiling
and gray with fog
and the fish
are nowhere to be seen
they fall they explode into the water
like white gloves
then they vanish
then they climb out again
from the cliff of the wave
like white flowers
and still i think
that nothing in this world moves
but as a positive power
even the fish finning down into the current
or collapsing
in the red purse of the beak
are only interrupted from their own pursuit
of whatever it is
that fills their bellies
and i say
life is real
and pain is real
but death is an imposter
and if i could be what once i was
like the wolf or the bear
standing on the cold shore
i would still see it
how the fish simply escape this time
or how they slide down into a black fire
for a moment
then rise from the water inseparable
from the gannets wings
have you ever tried to enter the long black branches of other lives
tried to imagine what the crisp fringes full of honey hanging
from the branches of the young locust trees in early morning feel like
do you think this world was only an entertainment for you
never to enter the sea and notice how the water divides
with perfect courtesy to let you in
never to lie down on the grass as though you were the grass
never to leap to the air as you open your wings over the dark acorn of your heart
no wonder we hear in your mournful voice the complaint
that something is missing from your life
who can open the door who does not reach for the latch
who can travel the miles who does not put one foot
in front of the other all attentive to what presents itself
continually
who will behold the inner chamber who has not observed
with admiration even with rapture the outer stone
well there is time left
fields everywhere invite you into them
and who will care who will chide you if you wander away
from wherever you are to look for your soul
quickly then get up put on your coat leave your desk
to put one s foot into the door of the grass which is
the mystery which is death as well as life and
not be afraid
to set one s foot in the door of death and be overcome
with amazement
to sit down in front of the weeds and imagine
god the ten fingered sailing out of his house of straw
nodding this way and that way to the flowers of the
present hour
to the song falling out of the mockingbird s pink mouth
to the tippets of the honeysuckle that have opened
in the night
to sit down like a weed among weeds and rustle in the wind
listen are you breathing just a little and calling it a life
while the soul after all is only a window
and the opening of the window no more difficult
than the wakening from a little sleep
only last week i went out among the thorns and said
to the wild roses
deny me not
but suffer my devotion
then all afternoon i sat among them maybe
i even heard a curl or tow of music damp and rouge red
hurrying from their stubby buds from their delicate watery bodies
for how long will you continue to listen to those dark shouters
caution and prudence
fall in fall in
a woman standing in the weeds
a small boat flounders in the deep waves and what s coming next
is coming with its own heave and grace
meanwhile once in a while i have chanced among the quick things
upon the immutable
what more could one ask
and i would touch the faces of the daises
and i would bow down
to think about it
that was then which hasn t ended yet
now the sun begins to swing down under the peach light
i cross the fields and the dunes i follow the ocean s edge
i climb i backtrack
i float
i ramble my way home
that time
i thought i could not
go any closer to grief
without dying
i went closer
and i did not die
surely god
had his hand in this
as well as friends
still i was bent
and my laughter
as the poet said
was nowhere to be found
then said my friend daniel
brave even among lions
it s not the weight you carry
but how you carry it
books bricks grief
it s all in the way
you embrace it balance it carry it
when you cannot and would not
put it down
so i went practicing
have you noticed
have you heard
the laughter
that comes now and again
out of my startled mouth
how i linger
to admire admire admire
the things of this world
that are kind and maybe
also troubled
roses in the wind
the sea geese on the steep waves
a love
to which there is no reply
so heavy
is the long necked long bodied heron
always it is a surprise
when her smoke colored wings
open
and she turns
from the thick water
from the black sticks
of the summer pond
and slowly
rises into the air
and is gone
then not for the first or the last time
i take the deep breath
of happiness and i think
how unlikely it is
that death is a hole in the ground
how improbable
that ascension is not possible
though everything seems so inert so nailed
back into itself
the muskrat and his lumpy lodge
the turtle
the fallen gate
and especially it is wonderful
that the summers are long
and the ponds so dark and so many
and therefore it isn t a miracle
but the common thing
this decision
this trailing of the long legs in the water
this opening up of the heavy body
into a new life see how the sudden
gray blue sheets of her wings
strive toward the wind see how the clasp of nothing
takes her in
it fills you with the soft
essence of vanished flowers it becomes
a trickle sharp as a hair that you follow
from the honey pot over the table
and out the door and over the ground
and all the while it thickens
grows deeper and wilder edged
with pine boughs and wet boulders
pawprints of bobcat and bear until
deep in the forest you
shuffle up some tree you rip the bark
you float into and swallow the dripping combs
bits of the tree crushed bees a taste
composed of everything lost in which everything lost is found
love love love says percy
and hurry as fast as you can
along the shining beach or the rubble or the dust
then go to sleep
give up your body heat your beating heart
then trust
i want to write something
so simply
about love
or about pain
that even
as you are reading
you feel it
and as you read
you keep feeling it
and though it be my story
it will be common
though it be singular
it will be known to you
so that by the end
you will think
no you will realize
that it was all the while
yourself arranging the words
that it was all the time
words that you yourself
out of your heart
had been saying
something
just now
moved through my heart
like the thinnest of blades
as that red tail pumped
once with its great wings
and flew above the gray cracked
rock wall
it wasn t
about the bird it was
something about the way
stone stays
mute and put whatever
goes flashing by
sometimes
when i sit like this quiet
all the dreams of my blood
and all outrageous divisions of time
seem ready to leave
to slide out of me
then i imagine i would never move
by now
the hawk has flown five miles
at least
dazzling whoever else has happened
to look up
i was dazzled but that
wasn t the knife
it was the sheer dense wall
of blind stone
without a pinch of hope
or a single unfulfilled desire
sponging up and reflecting
so brilliantly
as it has for centuries
the sun s fire
last night
the rain
spoke to me
slowly saying
what joy
to come falling
out of the brisk cloud
to be happy again
in a new way
on the earth
that s what it said
as it dropped
smelling of iron
and vanished
like a dream of the ocean
into the branches
and the grass below
then it was over
the sky cleared
i was standing
under a tree
the tree was a tree
with happy leaves
and i was myself
and there were stars in the sky
that were also themselves
at the moment
at which moment
my right hand
was holding my left hand
which was holding the tree
which was filled with stars
and the soft rain
imagine imagine
the long and wondrous journeys
still to be ours
the oaks shone
gaunt gold
on the lip
of the storm before
the wind rose
the shapeless mouth
opened and began
its five hour howl
the lights
went out fast branches
sidled over
the pitch of the roof bounced
into the year
that grew black
within minutes except
for the lightening the landscape
bulging forth like a quick
lesson in creating then
thudding away inside
as always
it was hard to tell
fear from excitement
how sensual
the lightning s
poured stroke and still
what a fire and a risk
as always the body
wants to hide
wants to flow toward it strives
to balance while
fear shouts
excitement shouts back
and forth each
bolt a burning river
tearing like escape through the dark
field of the other
i have been thinking
about living
like the lilies
that blow in the fields
they rise and fall
in the edge of the wind
and have no shelter
from the tongues of the cattle
and have no closets or cupboards
and have no legs
still i would like to be
as wonderful
as the old idea
but if i were a lily
i think i would wait all day
for the green face
of the hummingbird
to touch me
what i mean is
could i forget myself
even in those feathery fields
when van gogh
preached to the poor
of coarse he wanted to save someone
most of all himself
he wasn t a lily
and wandering through the bright fields
only gave him more ideas
it would take his life to solve
i think i will always be lonely
in this world where the cattle
graze like a black and white river
where the vanishing lilies
melt without protest on their tongues
where the hummingbird whenever there is a fuss
just rises and floats away
his beak could open a bottle
and his eyes when he lifts their soft lids
go on reading something
just beyond your shoulder
blake maybe
or the book of revelation
never mind that he eats only
the black smocked crickets
and the dragonflies if they happen
to be out late over the ponds and of course
the occasional festal mouse
never mind that he is only a memo
from the offices of fear
it s not size but surge that tells us
when we re in touch with something real
and when i hear him in the orchard
fluttering
down the little aliminum
ladder of his scream
when i see his wings open like two black ferns
a flurry of palpitations
as cold as sleet
rackets across the marshlands
of my heart
like a wild spring day
somewhere in the universe
in the gallery of important things
the babyish owl ruffled and rakish
sits on its pedestal
dear dark dapple of plush
a message reads the label
from that mysterious conglomerate
oblivion and co
the hooked head stares
from its house of dark feathery lace
it could be a valentine
every summer
i listen and look
under the sun s brass and even
into the moonlight but i can t hear
anything i can t see anything
not the pale roots digging down nor the green
stalks muscling up
nor the leaves
deepening their damp pleats
nor the tassels making
nor the shucks nor the cobs
and still
every day
the leafy fields
grow taller and thicker
green gowns lofting up in the night
showered with silk
and so every summer
i fail as a witness seeing nothing
i am deaf too
to the tick of the leaves
the tapping of downwardness from the banyan feet
all of it
happening
beyond any seeable proof or hearable hum
and therefore let the immeasurable come
let the unknowable touch the buckle of my spine
let the wind turn in the trees
and the mystery hidden in the dirt
swing through the air
how could i look at anything in this world
and tremble and grip my hands over my heart
what should i fear
one morning
in the leafy green ocean
the honeycomb of the corn s beautiful body
is sure to be there
out of the sump rise the marigolds
from the rim of the marsh muslin with mosquitoes
rises the egret in his cloud cloth
through the soft rain like mist and mica
the withered acres of moss begin again
when i have to die i would like to die
on a day of rain
long rain slow rain the kind you think will never end
and i would like to have whatever little ceremony there might be
take place while the rain is shoveled and shoveled out of the sky
and anyone who comes must travel slowly and with thought
as around the edges of the great swamp
every day
i see or hear
something
that more or less
kills me
with delight
that leaves me
like a needle
in the haystack
of light
it was what i was born for
to look to listen
to lose myself
inside this soft world
to instruct myself
over and over
in joy
and acclamation
nor am i talking
about the exceptional
the fearful the dreadful
the very extravagant
but of the ordinary
the common the very drab
the daily presentations
oh good scholar
i say to myself
how can you help
but grow wise
with such teachings
as these
the untrimmable light
of the world
the ocean s shine
the prayers that are made
out of grass
all my life
so far
i have loved
more than one thing
including the mossy hooves
of dreams including
the spongy litter
under the tall trees
in spring
the moccasin flowers
reach for the crackling
lick of the sun
and burn down sometimes
in the shadows
i see the hazy eyes
the lamb lips
of oblivion
its deep drowse
and i can imagine a new nothing
in the universe
the matted leaves splitting
open revealing
the black planks
of the stairs
but all my life sofar
i have loved best
how the flowers rise
and open how
the pink lungs of their bodies
enter the fore of the world
and stand there shining
and willing the one
thing they can do before
they shuffle forward
into the floor of darkness they
become the trees
this morning
two mockingbirds
in the green field
were spinning and tossing
the white ribbons
of their songs
into the air
i had nothing
better to do
than listen
i mean this
seriously
in greece
a long time ago
an old couple
opened their door
to two strangers
who were
it soon appeared
not men at all
but gods
it is my favorite story
how the old couple
had almost nothing to give
but their willingness
to be attentive
but for this alone
the gods loved them
and blessed them
when they rose
out of their mortal bodies
like a million particles of water
from a fountain
the light
swept into all the corners
of the cottage
and the old couple
shaken with understanding
bowed down
but still they asked for nothing
but the difficult life
which they had already
and the gods smiled as they vanished
clapping their great wings
wherever it was
i was supposed to be
this morning
whatever it was i said
i would be doing
i was standing
at the edge of the field
i was hurrying
through my own soul
opening its dark doors
i was leaning out
i was listening
under the leaves under
the first loose
levels of earth
they re there quick
as beetles blind
as bats shy
as hares but seen
less than these
traveling
among the pale girders
of appleroot
rockshelf nests
of insects and black
pastures of bulbs
peppery and packed full
of the sweetest food
spring flowers
field after field
you can see the traceries
of their long
lonely walks then
the rains blur
even this frail hint of them
so excitable
so plush
so willing to continue
generation after generation
accomplishing nothing
but their brief physical lives
as they live and die
pushing and shoving
with their stubborn muzzles against
the whole earth
finding it
delicious
blue and dark blue
rose and deepest rose
white and pink they
are everywhere in the diligent
cornfield rising and swaying
in their reliable
finery in the little
fling of their bodies their
gear and tackle
all caught up in the cornstalks
the reaper s story is the story
of endless work of
work careful and heavy but the
reaper cannot
separate them out there they
are in the story of his life
bright random useless
year after year
taken with the serious tons
weeds without value
humorous beautiful weeds
every morning
the world
is created
under the orange
sticks of the sun
the heaped
ashes of the night
turn into leaves again
and fasten themselves to the high branches
and the ponds appear
like black cloth
on which are painted islands
of summer lilies
if it is your nature
to be happy
you will swim away along the soft trails
for hours your imagination
alighting everywhere
and if your spirit
carries within it
the thorn
that is heavier than lead
if it s all you can do
to keep on trudging
there is still
somewhere deep within you
a beast shouting that the earth
is exactly what it wanted
each pond with its blazing lilies
is a prayer heard and answered
lavishly
every morning
whether or not
you have ever dared to be happy
whether or not
you have ever dared to pray
mushrooms
rain and then
the cool pursed
lips of the wind
draw them
out of the ground
red and yellow skulls
pummeling upward
through leaves
through grasses
through sand astonishing
in their suddenness
their quietude
their wetness they appear
on fall mornings some
balancing in the earth
on one hoof
packed with poison
others billowing
chunkily and delicious
those who know
walk out to gather choosing
the benign from flocks
of glitterers sorcerers
russulas
panther caps
shark white death angels
in their town veils
looking innocent as sugar
but full of paralysis
to eat
is to stagger down
fast as mushrooms themselves
when they are done being perfect
and overnight
slide back under the shining
fields of rain
i tied together
a few slender reeds cut
notches to breathe across and made
such music you stood
shock still and then
followed as i wandered growing
moment by moment
slant eyes and shaggy my feet
slamming over the rocks growing
hard as horn and there
you were behind me drowning
in the music letting
the silver clasps out of your hair
hurrying taking off
your clothes
i can t remember
where this happened but i think
it was late summer when everything
is full of fire and rounding to fruition
and whatever doesn t
or resists
must lie like a field of dark water under
the pulling moon
tossing and tossing
in the brutal elegance of cities
i have walked down
the halls of hotels
and heard this music behind
shut doors
do you think the heart
is accountable do you think the body
any more than a branch
of the honey locust tree
hunting water
hunching toward the sun
shivering when it feels
that good into
white blossoms
or do you think there is a kind
of music a certain strand
that lights up the otherwise
blunt wilderness of the body
a furious
and unaccountable selectivity
ah well anyway whether or not
it was late summer or even
in our part of the world it is all
only a dream i did not
turn into the lithe goat god nor did you come running
like that
did you
truly we live with mysteries too marvelous
to be understood
how grass can be nourishing in the
mouths of the lambs
how rivers and stones are forever
in allegiance with gravity
while we ourselves dream of rising
how two hands touch and the bonds will
never be broken
how people come from delight or the
scars of damage
to the comfort of a poem
let me keep my distance always from those
who think they have the answers
let me keep company always with those who say
look and laugh in astonishment
and bow their heads
next time what i d do is look at
the earth before saying anything i d stop
just before going into a house
and be an emperor for a minute
and listen better to the wind
or to the air being still
when anyone talked to me whether
blame or praise or just passing time
i d watch the face how the mouth
has to work and see any strain any
sign of what lifted the voice
and for all i d know more the earth
bracing itself and soaring the air
finding every leaf and feather over
forest and water and for every person
the body glowing inside the clothes
like a light
on winter s margin see the small birds now
with half forged memories come flocking home
to gardens famous for their charity
the green globe s broken vines like tangled veins
hang at the entrance to the silent wood
with half a loaf i am the prince of crumbs
by snow s down the birds amassed will sing
like children for their sire to walk abroad
but what i love is the gray stubborn hawk
who floats alone beyond the frozen vines
and what i dream of are the patient deer
who stand on legs like reeds and drink that wind
they are what saves the world who choose to grow
thin to a starting point beyond this squalor
the mosquito is so small
it takes almost nothing to ruin it
each leaf the same
and the black ant hurrying
so many lives so many fortunes
every morning i walk softly and with forward glances
down to the ponds and through the pinewoods
mushrooms even have but a brief hour
before the slug creeps to the feast
before the pine needles hustle down
under the bundles of harsh beneficent rain
how many how many how many
make up a world
and then i think of that old idea the singular
and the eternal
one cup in which everything is swirled
back to the color of the sea and sky
imagine it
a shining cup surely
in the moment in which there is no wind
over your shoulder
you stare down into it
and there you are
your own darling face your own eyes
and then the wind not thinking of you just passes by
touching the ant the mosquito the leaf
and you know what else
how blue is the sea how blue is the sky
how blue and tiny and redeemable everything is even you
even your eyes even your imagination
this morning the green fists of the peonies are getting ready
to break my heart
as the sun rises
as the sun strokes them with his old buttery fingers
and they open
pools of lace
white and pink
and all day the black ants climb over them
boring their deep and mysterious holes
into the curls
craving the sweet sap
taking it away
to their dark underground cities
and all day
under the shifty wind
as in a dance to the great wedding
the flowers bend their bright bodies
and tip their fragrance to the air
and rise
their red stems holding
all that dampness and recklessness
gladly and lightly
and there it is again
beauty the brave the exemplary
blazing open
do you love this world
do you cherish your humble and silky life
do you adore the green grass with its terror beneath
do you also hurry half dressed and barefoot into the garden
and softly
and exclaiming of their dearness
fill your arms with the white and pink flowers
with their honeyed heaviness their lush trembling
their eagerness
to be wild and perfect for a moment before they are
nothing forever
once in summer
in the blueberries
i fell asleep and woke
when a deer stumbled against me
i guess
she was so busy with her own happiness
she had grown careless
and was just wandering along
listening
to the wind as she leaned down
to lip up the sweetness
so there we were
with nothing between us
but a few leaves and wind s
glossy voice
shouting instructions
the deer
backed away finally
and flung up her white tail
and went floating off toward the trees
but the moment she did that
was so wide and so deep
it has lasted to this day
i have only to think of her
the flower of her amazement
and the stalled breath of her curiosity
and even the damp touch of her solicitude
before she took flight
to be absent again from this world
and alive again in another
for thirty years
sleepy and amazed
rising out of the rough weeds
listening and looking
beautiful girl
where are you
the spirit
likes to dress up like this
ten fingers
ten toes
shoulders and all the rest
at night
in the black branches
in the morning
in the blue branches
of the world
it could float of course
but would rather
plumb rough matter
airy and shapeless thing
it needs
the metaphor of the body
lime and appetite
the oceanic fluids
it needs the body s world
instinct
and imagination
and the dark hug of time
sweetness
and tangibility
to be understood
to be more than pure light
that burns
where no one is
so it enters us
in the morning
shines from brute comfort
like a stitch of lightning
and at night
lights up the deep and wondrous
drownings of the body
like a star
the poppies send up their
orange flares swaying
in the wind their congregations
are a levitation
of bright dust of thin
and lacy leaves
there isn t a place
in this world that doesn t
sooner or later drown
in the indigos of darkness
but now for a while
the roughage
shines like a miracle
as it floats above everything
with its yellow hair
of course nothing stops the cold
black curved blade
from hooking forward
of course
loss is the great lesson
but i also say this that light
is an invitation
to happiness
and that happiness
when it s done right
is a kind of holiness
palpable and redemptive
inside the bright fields
touched by their rough and spongy gold
i am washed and washed
in the river
of earthly delight
and what are you going to do
what can you do
about it
deep blue night
it doesn t have to be
the blue iris it could be
weeds in a vacant lot or a few
small stones just
pay attention then patch
a few words together and don t try
to make them elaborate this isn t
a contest but the doorway
into thanks and a silence in which
another voice may speak
today again i am hardly myself
it happens over and over
it is heaven sent
it flows through me
like the blue wave
green leaves you may believe this or not
have once or twice
emerged from the tips of my fingers
somewhere
deep in the woods
in the reckless seizure of spring
though of course i also know that other song
the sweet passion of one ness
just yesterday i watched an ant crossing a path through the
tumbled pine needles she toiled
and i thought she will never live another life but this one
and i thought if she lives her life with all her strength
is she not wonderful and wise
and i continued this up the miraculous pyramid of everything
until i came to myself
and still even in these northern woods on these hills of sand
i have flown from the other window of myself
to become white heron blue whale
red fox hedgehog
oh sometimes already my body has felt like the body of a flower
sometimes already my heart is a red parrot perched
among strange dark trees flapping and screaming
what men build in the name of security is built of straw
does the grain of sand know it is a grain of sand
my dog ben a mouth like a tabernacle
you can have the other words chance luck coincidence
serendipity i ll take grace i don t know what it is exactly but
i ll take it
the pine cone has secrets it will never tell
myself myself myself that darling hut
how quick it will burn
death listens
to the hum and strike of my words
his laughter spills
spring there rises up from the earth such a blazing sweetness
it fills you thank god with disorder
i am a performing artist i perform admiration
come with me i want my poems to say and do the same
in singapore in the airport
a darkness was ripped from my eyes
in the women s restroom one compartment stood open
a woman knelt there washing something
in the white bowl
disgust argued in my stomach
and i felt in my pocket for my ticket
a poem should always have birds in it
kingfishers say with their bold eyes and gaudy wings
rivers are pleasant and of course trees
a waterfall or if that s not possible a fountain
rising and falling
a person wants to stand in a happy place in a poem
when the woman turned i could not answer her face
her beauty and her embarrassment struggled together and
neither could win
she smiled and i smiled what kind of nonsense is this
everybody needs a job
yes a person wants to stand in a happy place in a poem
but first we must watch her as she stares down at her labor
which is dull enough
she is washing the tops of the airport ashtrays as big as
hubcaps with a blue rag
her small hands turn the metal scrubbing and rinsing
she does not work slowly nor quickly but like a river
her dark hair is like the wing of a bird
i don t doubt for a moment that she loves her life
and i want her to rise up from the crust and the slop
and fly down to the river
this probably won t happen
but maybe it will
if the world were only pain and logic who would want it
of course it isn t
neither do i mean anything miraculous but only
the light that can shine out of a life i mean
the way she unfolded and refolded the blue cloth
the way her smile was only for my sake i mean
the way this poem is filled with trees and birds
and now as the iron rinds over
the ponds start dissolving
you come dreaming of ferns and flowers
and new leaves unfolding
upon the brash
turnip hearted skunk cabbage
slinging its bunches leaves up
through the chilling mud
you kneel beside it the smell
is lurid and flows out in the most
unabashed way attracting
into itself a continual spattering
of protein appalling its rough
green caves and the thought
of the thick root nested below stubborn
and powerful as instinct
but these are the woods you love
where the secret name
of every death is life again a miracle
wrought surely not of mere turning
but of dense and scalding reenactment not
tenderness not longing but daring and brawn
pull down the frozen waterfall the past
ferns leaves flowers the last subtle
refinements elegant and easeful wait
to rise and flourish
what blazes the trail is not necessarily pretty
i thought the earth remembered me
she took me back so tenderly
arranging her dark skirts her pockets
full of lichens and seeds
i slept as never before a stone on the river bed
nothing between me and the white fire of the stars
but my thoughts and they floated light as moths
among the branches of the perfect trees
all night i heard the small kingdoms
breathing around me the insects
and the birds who do their work in the darkness
all night i rose and fell as if in water
grappling with a luminous doom by morning
i had vanished at least a dozen times
into something better
oh to love what is lovely and will not last
what a task
to ask
of anything or anyone
yet it is ours
and not by the century or the year but by the hours
one fall day i heard
above me and above the sting of the wind a sound
i did not know and my look shot upward it was
a flock of snow geese winging it
faster than the ones we usually see
and being the color of snow catching the sun
so they were in part at least golden i
held my breath
as we do
sometimes
to stop time
when something wonderful
has touched us
as with a match
which is lit and bright
but does not hurt
in the common way
but delightfully
as if delight
were the most serious thing
you ever felt
the geese
flew on
i have never seen them again
maybe i will someday somewhere
maybe i won t
it doesn t matter
what matters
is that when i saw them
i saw them
as through the veil secretly joyfully clearly
last night an owl
in the blue dark
tossed
an indeterminate number
of carefully shaped sounds into
the world in which
a quarter of a mile away i happened
to be standing
i couldn t tell
which one it was
the barred or the great horned
ship of the air
it was that distant but anyway
aren t there moments
that are better than knowing something
and sweeter snow was falling
so much like stars
filling the dark trees
that one could easily imagine
its reason for being was nothing more
than prettiness i suppose
if this were someone else s story
they would have insisted on knowing
whatever is knowable would have hurried
over the fields
to name it the owl i mean
but it s mine this poem of the night
and i just stood there listening and holding out
my hands to the soft glitter
falling through the air i love this world
but not for its answers
and i wish good luck to the owl
whatever its name
and i wish great welcome to the snow
whatever its severe and comfortless
and beautiful meaning
times in the morning early
when it rained and the long gray
buildings came forward from darkness
offering their windows for light
evenings out there on the plains
when sunset donated farms
that yearned so far to the west that the world
centered there and bowed down
a teacher at a country school
walking home past a great marsh
where ducks came gliding in
she saw the boy out hunting and waved
silence on a hill where the path ended
and then the forest below
moving in one long whisper
as evening touched the leaves
shelter in winter that day
a storm coming but in the lee
of an island in a cover with friends
oh little bright cup of sun
something came up
out of the dark
it wasn t anything i had ever seen before
it wasn t an animal
or a flower
unless it was both
something came up out of the water
a head the size of a cat
but muddy and without ears
i don t know what god is
i don t know what death is
but i believe they have between them
some fervent and necessary arrangement
sometime
melancholy leaves me breathless
water from the heavens electricity from the source
both of them mad to create something
the lighting brighter than any flower
the thunder without a drowsy bone in its body
instructions for living a life
pay attention
be astonished
tell about it
two or three times in my life i discovered love
each time it seemed to solve everything
each time it solved a great many things
but not everything
yet left me as grateful as if it had indeed and
thoroughly solved everything
god rest in my heart
and fortify me
take away my hunger for answers
let the hours play upon my body
like the hands of my beloved
let the cathead appear again
the smallest of your mysteries
some wild cousin of my own blood probably
some cousin of my own wild blood probably
in the black dinner bowl of the pond
death waits for me i know it around
one corner or another
this doesn t amuse me
neither does it frighten me
after the rain i went back into the field of sunflowers
it was cool and i was anything but drowsy
i walked slowly and listened
to the crazy roots in the drenched earth laughing and growing
on a summer morning
i sat down
on a hillside
to think about god
a worthy pastime
near me i saw
a single cricket
it was moving the grains of the hillside
this way and that way
how great was its energy
how humble its effort
let us hope
it will always be like this
each of us going on
in our inexplicable ways
building the universe
somewhere
a black bear
has just risen from sleep
and is staring
down the mountain
all night
in the brisk and shallow restlessness
of early spring
i think of her
her four black fists
flicking the gravel
her tongue
like a red fire
touching the grass
the cold water
there is only one question
how to love this world
i think of her
rising
like a black and leafy ledge
to sharpen her claws against
the silence
of the trees
whatever else
my life is
with its poems
and its music
and its glass cities
it is also this dazzling darkness
coming
down the mountain
breathing and tasting
all day i think of her
her white teeth
her wordlessness
her perfect love
i used to imagine him
coming from his house like merlin
strolling with important gestures
through the garden
where everything grows so thickly
where birds sing little snakes lie
on the boughs thinking of nothing
but their own good lives
where petals float upward
their colors exploding
and trees open their moist
pages of thunder
it has happened every summer for years
but now i know more
about the great wheel of growth
and decay and rebirth
and know my vision for a falsehood
now i see him coming from the house
i see him on his knees
cutting away the diseased the superfluous
coaxing the new
know that the hour of fulfillment
is buried in years of patience
yet willing to labor like that
on the mortal wheel
oh what good it does the heart
to know it isn t magic
like the human child i am
i rush to imitate
i watch him as he bends
among the leaves and vines
to hook some weed or other
i think of him there
raking and trimming stirring up
those sheets of fire
between the smothering weights of earth
the wild and shapeless air
chunky and noisy
but with stars in their black feathers
they spring from the telephone wire
and instantly
they are acrobats
in the freezing wind
and now in the theater of air
they swing over buildings
dipping and rising
they float like one stippled star
that opens
becomes for a moment fragmented
then closes again
and you watch
and you try
but you simply can t imagine
how they do it
with no articulated instruction no pause
only the silent confirmation
that they are this notable thing
this wheel of many parts that can rise and spin
over and over again
full of gorgeous life
ah world what lessons you prepare for us
even in the leafless winter
even in the ashy city
i am thinking now
of grief and of getting past it
i feel my boots
trying to leave the ground
i feel my heart
pumping hard i want
to think again of dangerous and noble things
i want to be light and frolicsome
i want to be improbable beautiful and afraid of nothing
as though i had wings
it was spring
and finally i heard him
among the first leaves
then i saw him clutching the limb
in an island of shade
with his red brown feathers
all trim and neat for the new year
first i stood still
and thought of nothing
then i began to listen
then i was filled with gladness
and that s when it happened
when i seemed to float
to be myself a wing or a tree
and i began to understand
what the bird was saying
and the sands in the glass
stopped
for a pure white moment
while gravity sprinkled upward
like rain rising
and in fact
it became difficult to tell just what it was that was singing
it was the thrush for sure but it seemed
not a single thrush but himself and all his brothers
and also the trees around them
as well as the gliding long tailed clouds
in the perfectly blue sky all all of them
were singing
and of course yes so it seemed
so was i
such soft and solemn and perfect music doesn t last
for more than a few moments
it s one of those magical places wise people
like to talk about
one of the things they say about it that is true
is that once you ve been there
you re there forever
listen everyone has a chance
is it spring is it morning
are there trees near you
and does your own soul need comforting
quick then open the door and fly on your heavy feet the song
may already be drifting away
you can
die for it
an idea
or the world people
have done so
brilliantly
letting
their small bodies be bound
to the stake
creating
an unforgettable
fury of light but
this morning
climbing the familiar hills
in the familiar
fabric of dawn i thought
of china
and india
and europe and i thought
how the sun
blazes
for everyone just
so joyfully
as it rises
under the lashes
of my own eyes and i thought
i am so many
what is my name
what is the name
of the deep breath i would take
over and over
for all of us call it
whatever you want it is
happiness it is another one
of the ways to enter
fire
that sweet flute john clare
that broken branch eddy whitman
christopher smart in the press of blazing electricity
my uncle the suicide
woolf on her way to the river
wolf of the sorrowful songs
swift impenetrable mask of dublin
schumann climbing the bridge leaping into the rhine
ruskin cowper
poe rambling in the gloom bins of baltimore and richmond
light of the world hold me
the arrowhead
which i found beside the river
was glittering and pointed
i picked it up and said
now it s mine
i thought of showing it to friends
i thought of putting it such an imposing trinket
in a little box on my desk
halfway home past the cut fields
the old ghost
stood under the hickories
i would rather drink the wind he said
i would rather eat mud and die
than steal as you steal
than lie as you lie
make of yourself a light
said the buddha
before he died
i think of this every morning
as the east begins
to tear off its many clouds
of darkness to send up the first
signal a white fan
streaked with pink and violet
even green
an old man he lay down
between two sala trees
and he might have said anything
knowing it was his final hour
the light burns upward
it thickens and settles over the fields
around him the villagers gathered
and stretched forward to listen
even before the sun itself
hangs disattached in the blue air
i am touched everywhere
by its ocean of yellow waves
no doubt he thought of everything
that had happened in his difficult life
and then i feel the sun itself
as it blazes over the hills
like a million flowers on fire
clearly i m not needed
yet i feel myself turning
into something of inexplicable value
slowly beneath the branches
he raised his head
he looked into the faces of that frightened crowd
all summer i made friends
with the creatures nearby
they flowed through the fields
and under the tent walls
or padded through the door
grinning through their many teeth
looking for seeds
suet sugar muttering and humming
opening the breadbox happiest when
there was milk and music but once
in the night i heard a sound
outside the door the canvas
bulged slightly something
was pressing inward at eye level
i watched trembling sure i had heard
the click of claws the smack of lips
outside my gauzy house
i imagined the red eyes
the broad tongue the enormous lap
would it be friendly too
fear defeated me and yet
not in faith and not in madness
but with the courage i thought
my dream deserved
i stepped outside it was gone
then i whirled at the sound of some
shambling tonnage
did i see a black haunch slipping
back through the trees did i see
the moonlight shining on it
did i actually reach out my arms
toward it toward paradise falling like
the fading of the dearest wildest hope
the dark heart of the story that is all
the reason for its telling
the dark things of the wood
are coming from their caves
flexing muscle
they browse the orchard
nibble the sea of grasses
around our yellow rooms
scarcely looking in
to see what we are doing
and if they still know us
we hear them or think we do
the muzzle lapping moonlight
the tooth in the apple
put another log on the fire
mozart again on the turntable
still there is a sorrow
with us in the room
we remember the cave
in our dreams we go back
or they come to visit
they also like music
we eat leaves together
they are our brothers
they are the family
we have run away from
the first fish
i ever caught
would not lie down
quiet in the pail
but flailed and sucked
at the burning
amazement of the air
and died
in the slow pouring off
of rainbows later
i opened his body and separated
the flesh from the bones
and ate him now the sea
is in me i am the fish the fish
glitters in me we are
risen tangled together certain to fall
back to the sea out of pain
and pain and more pain
we feed this feverish plot we are nourished
by the mystery
listen whatever it is you try
to do with your life nothing will ever dazzle you
like the dreams of your body
its spirit
longing to fly while the dead weight bones
toss their dark mane and hurry
back into the fields of glittering fire
where everything
even the great whale
throbs with song
one day you finally knew
what you had to do and began
though the voices around you
kept shouting
their bad advice
though the whole house
began to tremble
and you felt the old tug
at your ankles
mend my life
each voice cried
but you didn t stop
you knew what you had to do
though the wind pried
with its stiff fingers
at the very foundations
though their melancholy
was terrible
it was already late
enough and a wild night
and the road full of fallen
branches and stones
but little by little
as you left their voices behind
the stars began to burn
through the sheets of clouds
and there was a new voice
which you slowly
recognized as your own
that kept you company
as you strode deeper and deeper
into the world
determined to do
the only thing you could do
determined to save
the only life you could save
the kingfisher rises out of the black wave
like a blue flower in his beak
he carries a silver leaf i think this is
the prettiest world so long as you don t mind
a little dying how could there be a day in your
whole life
that doesn t have its splash of happiness
there are more fish than there are leaves
on a thousand trees and anyway the kingfisher
wasn t born to think about it or anything else
when the wave snaps shut over his blue head the
water
remains water hunger is the only story
he has ever heard in his life that he could
believe
i don t say he s right neither
do i say he s wrong religiously he swallows the
silver leaf
with its broken red river and with a rough and
easy cry
i couldn t rouse out of my thoughtful body
if my life depended on it he swings back
over the bright sea to do the same thing to do it
as i long to do something anything perfectly
in every heart there is a coward and a procrastinator
in every heart there is a god of flowers just waiting
to stride out of a cloud and lift its wings
the kookaburras pressed against the edge of their cage
asked me to open the door
years later i remember how i didn t do it
how instead i walked away
they had the brown eyes of soft hearted dogs
they didn t want to do anything so extraordinary only to fly
home to their river
by now i suppose the great darkness has covered them
as for myself i am not yet a god of even the palest flowers
nothing else has changed either
someone tosses their white bones to the dung heap
the sun shines on the latch of their cage
i lie in the dark my heart pounding
and i have seen
at dawn
the lark
spin out of the long grass
and into the pink air
its wings
which are neither wide
nor overstrong
fluttering
the pectorals
ploughing and flashing
for nothing but altitude
and the song
bursting
all the while
from the red throat
and then he descends
and is sorry
his little head hangs
and he pants for breath
for a few moments
among the hoops of the grass
which are crisp and dry
where most of his living is done
and then something summons him again
and up he goes
his shoulders working
his whole body almost collapsing and floating
to the edges of the world
we are reconciled i think
to too much
better to be a bird like this one
an ornament of the eternal
as he came down once to the nest of the grass
squander the day but save the soul
i heard him say
night after night
darkness
enters the face
of the lily
which lightly
closes its five walls
around itself
and its purse
of honey
and its fragrance
and is content
to stand there
in the garden
not quite sleeping
and maybe
saying in lily language
some small words
we can t hear
even when there is no wind
anywhere
its lips
are so secret
its tongue
is so hidden
or maybe
it says nothing at all
but just stands there
with the patience
of vegetables
and saints
until the whole earth has turned around
and the silver moon
becomes the golden sun
as the lily absolutely knew it would
which is itself isn t it
the perfect prayer
there s a kind of white moth i don t know
what kind that glimmers
by mid may
in the forest just
as the pink mocassin flowers
are rising
if you notice anything
it leads you to notice
more
and more
and anyway
i was so full of energy
i was always running around looking
at this and that
if i stopped
the pain
was unbearable
if i stopped and thought maybe
the world
can t be saved
the pain
was unbearable
finally i noticed enough
all around me in the forest
the white moths floated
how long do they live fluttering
in and out of the shadows
you aren t much i said
one day to my reflection
in a green pond
and grinned
the wings of the moths catch the sunlight
and burn
so brightly
at night sometimes
they slip between the pink lobes
of the moccasin flowers and lie there until dawn
motionless
in those dark halls of honey
wherever i am the world comes after me
it offers me its busyness it does not believe
that i do not want it now i understand
why the old poets of china went so far and high
into the mountains then crept into the pale mist
you want to cry aloud for your
mistakes but to tell the truth the world
doesn t need anymore of that sound
so if you re going to do it and can t
stop yourself if your pretty mouth can t
hold it in at least go by yourself across
the forty fields and the forty dark inclines
of rocks and water to the place where
the falls are flinging out their white sheets
like crazy and there is a cave behind all that
jubilation and water fun and you can
stand there under it and roar all you
want and nothing will be disturbed you can
drip with despair all afternoon and still
on a green branch its wings just lightly touched
by the passing foil of the water the thrush
puffing out its spotted breast will sing
of the perfect stone hard beauty of everything
every year
the lilies
are so perfect
i can hardly believe
their lapped light crowding
the black
mid summer ponds
nobody could count all of them
the muskrats swimming
among the pads and the grasses
can reach out
their muscular arms and touch
only so many they are that
rife and wild
but what in this world
is perfect
i bend closer and see
how this one is clearly lopsided
and that one wears an orange blight
and this one is a glossy cheek
half nibbled away
and that one is a slumped purse
full of its own
unstoppable decay
still what i want in my life
is to be willing
to be dazzled
to cast aside the weight of facts
and maybe even
to float a little
above this difficult world
i want to believe i am looking
into the white fire of a great mystery
i want to believe that the imperfections are nothing
that the light is everything that it is more than the sum
of each flawed blossom rising and fading and i do
all summer
i wandered the fields
that were thickening
every morning
every rainfall
with weeds and blossoms
with the long loops
of the shimmering and the extravagant
pale as flames they rose
and fell back
replete and beautiful
that was all there was
and i too
once or twice at least
felt myself rising
my boots
touching suddenly the tops of the weeds
the blue and silky air
listen
passion did it
called me forth
addled me
stripped me clean
then covered me with the cloth of happiness
i think there is no other prize
only rapture the gleaming
rapture the illogical the weightless
whether it be for the perfect shapeliness
of something you love
like an old german song
or of someone
or the dark floss of the earth itself
heavy and electric
at the edge of sweet sanity open
such wild blind wings
who made the world
who made the swan and the black bear
who made the grasshopper
this grasshopper i mean
the one who has flung herself out of the grass
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes
now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face
now she snaps her wings open and floats away
i don t know exactly what a prayer is
i do know how to pay attention how to fall down
into the grass how to kneel in the grass
how to be idle and blessed how to stroll through the fields
which is what i have been doing all day
tell me what else should i have done
doesn t everything die at last and too soon
tell me what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life
have you ever seen
anything
in your life
more wonderful
than the way the sun
every evening
relaxed and easy
floats toward the horizon
and into the clouds or the hills
or the rumpled sea
and is gone
and how it slides again
out of the blackness
every morning
on the other side of the world
like a red flower
streaming upward on its heavenly oils
say on a morning in early summer
at its perfect imperial distance
and have you ever felt for anything
such wild love
do you think there is anywhere in any language
a word billowing enough
for the pleasure
that fills you
as the sun
reaches out
as it warms you
as you stand there
empty handed
or have you too
turned from this world
or have you too
gone crazy
for power
for things
did you too see it drifting all night on the black river
did you see it in the morning rising into the silvery air
an armful of white blossoms
a perfect commotion of silk and linen as it leaned
into the bondage of its wings a snowbank a bank of lilies
biting the air with its black beak
did you hear it fluting and whistling
a shrill dark music like the rain pelting the trees like a waterfall
knifing down the black ledges
and did you see it finally just under the clouds
a white cross streaming across the sky its feet
like black leaves its wings like the stretching light of the river
and did you feel it in your heart how it pertained to everything
and have you too finally figured out what beauty is for
and have you changed your life
there s a bear in the truro woods
people have seen it three or four
or two or one i think
of the thickness of the serious woods
around the dark bowls of the truro ponds
i think of the blueberry fields the blackberry tangles
the cranberry bogs and the sky
with its new moon its familiar star trails
burns down like a brand new heaver
while everywhere i look on the scratchy hillsides
shadows seem to grow shoulders surely
a beast might be clever be lucky move quietly
through the woods for years learning to stay away
from roads and houses common sense mutters
it can t be true it must be somebody s
runaway dog but the seed
has been planted and when has happiness ever
required much evidence to begin
its leaf green breathing
i would like to write a poem about the world that has in it
nothing fancy
but it seems impossible
whatever the subject the morning sun
glimmers it
the tulip feels the heat and flaps its petals open and becomes a star
the ants bore into the peony bud and there is a dark
pinprick well of sweetness
as for the stones on the beach forget it
each one could be set in gold
so i tried with my eyes shut but of course the birds
were singing
and the aspen trees were shaking the sweetest music
out of their leaves
and that was followed by guess what a momentous and
beautiful silence
as comes to all of us in little earfuls if we re not too
hurried to hear it
as for spiders how the dew hangs in their webs
even if they say nothing or seem to say nothing
so fancy is the world who knows maybe they sing
so fancy is the world who knows maybe the stars sing too
and the ants and the peonies and the warm stones
so happy to be where they are on the beach instead of being
locked up in gold
we must begin to catch hold of everything
around us for nobody knows what we
may need we have to carry along
the air even and the weight we once
thought a burden turns out to form
the pulse of our life and the compass for our brain
colors balance our fears and existence
begins to clog unless our thoughts
can occur unwatched and let a fountain of essential silliness
out through our dreams
and oh i hope we can still arrange
for the wind to blow and occasionally
some kind of shock to occur like rain
and stray adventures no one cares about
harmless love immoderate guffaws on corners
families crawling around the front room growling
being bears in the piano cave
now i see it
it nudges with its bulldog head
the slippery stems of the lilies making them tremble
and now it noses along in the wake of the little brown teal
who is leading her soft children
from one side of the pond to the other she keeps
close to the edge
and they follow closely the good children
the tender children
the sweet children dangling their pretty feet
into the darkness
and now will come i can count on it the murky splash
the certain victory
of that pink and gassy mouth and the frantic
circling of the hen while the rest of the chicks
flare away over the water and into the reeds and my heart
will be most mournful
on their account but listen
what s important
nothing s important
except that the great and cruel mystery of the world
of which this is a part
not to be denied once
i happened to see on a city street in summer
a dusty fouled turtle plodded along
a snapper
broken out i suppose from some backyard cage
and i knew what i had to do
i looked it right in the eyes and i caught it
i put it like a small mountain range
into a knapsack and i took it out
of the city and i let it
down into the dark pond into
the cool water
and the light of the lilies
to live
last night the geese came back
slanting fast
from the blossom of the rising moon down
to the black pond a muskrat
swimming in the twilight saw them and hurried
to the secret lodges to tell everyone
spring had come
and so it had
by morning when i went out
the last of the ice had disappeared blackbirds
sang on the shores every year
the geese returning
do this i don t
know how
the curtains opened and there was
an old man in a headdress of feathers
leather leggings and a vest made
from the skin of some animal he danced
in a kind of surly rapture and the trees
in the fields far away
began to mutter and suck up their long roots
slowly they advanced until they stood
pressed to the schoolhouse windows
i don t know
lots of things but i know this next year
when spring
flows over the starting point i ll think i m going to
drown in the shimmering miles of it and then
one or two birds will fly me over
the threshold
as for the pain
of others of course it tries to be
abstract but then
there flares up out of a vanished wilderness like fire
still blistering the wrinkled face
of an old chippewa
smiling hating us
dancing for his life
what is so utterly invisible
as tomorrow
not love
not the wind
not the inside of a stone
not anything
and yet how often i m fooled
i m wading along
in the sunlight
and i m sure i can see the fields and the ponds shining
days ahead
i can see the light spilling
like a shower of meteors
into next week s trees
and i plan to be there soon
and so far i am
just that lucky
my legs splashing
over the edge of darkness
my heart on fire
i don t know where
such certainty comes from
the brave flesh
or the theater of the mind
but if i had to guess
i would say that only
what the soul is supposed to be
could send us forth
with such cheer
as even the leaf must wear
as it unfurls
its fragrant body and shines
against the hard possibility of stoppage
which day after day
before such brisk corpuscular belief
shudders and gives way
meditation is old and honorable so why should i
not sit every morning of my life on the hillside
looking into the shining world because properly
attended to delight as well as havoc is suggestion
can one be passionate about the just the
ideal the sublime and the holy and yet commit
to no labor in its cause i don t think so
all summations have a beginning all effect has a
story all kindness begins with the sown seed
thought buds toward radiance the gospel of
light is the crossroads of indolence or action
be ignited or be gone
when death comes
like the hungry bear in autumn
when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse
to buy me and snaps the purse shut
when death comes
like the measle pox
when death comes
like an iceberg between the shoulder blades
i want to step through the door full of curiosity wondering
what is it going to be like that cottage of darkness
and therefore i look upon everything
as a brotherhood and a sisterhood
and i look upon time as no more than an idea
and i consider eternity as another possibility
and i think of each life as a flower as common
as a field daisy and as singular
and each name a comfortable music in the mouth
tending as all music does toward silence
and each body a lion of courage and something
precious to the earth
when it s over i want to say all my life
i was a bride married to amazement
i was the bridegroom taking the world into my arms
when it s over i don t want to wonder
if i have made of my life something particular and real
i don t want to find myself sighing and frightened
or full of argument
i don t want to end up simply having visited this world
don t call this world adorable or useful that s not it
it s frisky and a theater for more than fair winds
the eyelash of lightning is neither good nor evil
the struck tree burns like a pillar of gold
but the blue rain sinks straight to the white
feet of the trees
whose mouths open
doesn t the wind turning in circles invent the dance
haven t the flowers moved slowly across asia then europe
until at last now they shine
in your own yard
don t call this world an explanation or even an education
when the sufi poet whirled was he looking
outward to the mountains so solidly there
in a white capped ring or was he looking
to the center of everything the seed the egg the idea
that was also there
beautiful as a thumb
curved and touching the finger tenderly
little love ring
as he whirled
oh jug of breath
in the garden of dust
all night
i float
in the shallow ponds
while the moon wanders
burning
bone white
among the milky stems
once
i saw her hand reach
to touch the muskrat s
small sleek head
and it was lovely oh
i don t want to argue anymore
about all the things
i thought i could not
live without soon
the muskrat
will glide with another
into their castle
of weeds morning
will rise from the east
tangled and brazen
and before that
difficult
and beautiful
hurricane of light
i want to flow out
across the mother
of all waters
i want to lose myself
on the black
and silky currents
yawning
gathering
the tall lilies
of sleep
bone
understand i am always trying to figure out
what the soul is
and where hidden
and what shape
and so last week
when i found on the beach
the ear bone
of a pilot whale that may have died
hundreds of years ago i thought
maybe i was close
to discovering something
for the ear bone
is the portion that lasts longest
in any of us man or whale shaped
like a squat spoon
with a pink scoop where
once in the lively swimmer s head
it joined its two sisters
in the house of hearing
it was only
two inches long
and thought the soul
might be like this
so hard so necessary
yet almost nothing
beside me
the gray sea
was opening and shutting its wave doors
unfolding over and over
its time ridiculing roar
i looked but i couldn t see anything
through its dark knit glare
yet don t we all know the golden sand
is there at the bottom
though our eyes have never seen it
nor can our hands ever catch it
lest we would sift it down
into fractions and facts
certainties
and what the soul is also
i believe i will never quite know
though i play at the edges of knowing
truly i know
our part is not knowing
but looking and touching and loving
which is the way i walked on
softly
through the pale pink morning light
you do not have to be good
you do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting
you only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves
tell me about despair yours and i will tell you mine
meanwhile the world goes on
meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes
over the prairies and the deep trees
the mountains and the rivers
meanwhile the wild geese high in the clean blue air
are heading home again
whoever you are no matter how lonely
the world offers itself to your imagination
calls to you like the wild geese harsh and exciting
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things
how necessary it is to have opinions i think the spotted trout
lilies are satisfied standing a few inches above the earth i
think serenity is not something you just find in the world
like a plum tree holding up its white petals
the violets along the river are opening their blue faces like
small dark lanterns
the green mosses being so many are as good as brawny
how important it is to walk along not in haste but slowly
looking at everything and calling out
yes no the
swan for all his pomp his robes of grass and petals wants
only to be allowed to live on the nameless pond the catbrier
is without fault the water thrushes down among the sloppy
rocks are going crazy with happiness imagination is better
than a sharp instrument to pay attention this is our endless
and proper work
