there is a thing in me that dreamed of trees
a quiet house some green and modest acres
a little way from every troubling town
a little way from factories schools laments
i would have time i thought and time to spare
with only streams and birds for company
to build out of my life a few wild stanzas
and then it came to me that so was death
a little way away from everywhere
there is a thing in me still dreams of trees
but let it go homesick for moderation
half the world s artists shrink or fall away
if any find solution let him tell it
meanwhile i bend my heart toward lamentation
where as the times implore our true involvement
the blades of every crisis point the way
i would it were not so but so it is
who ever made music of a mild day
she sends me news of blue jays frost
of stars and now the harvest moon
that rides above the stricken hills
lightly she speaks of cold of pain
and lists what is already lost
here where my life seems hard and slow
i read of glowing melons piled
beside the door and baskets filled
with fennel rosemary and dill
while all she could not gather in
or hid in leaves grow black and falls
here where my life seems hard and strange
i read her wild excitement when
stars climb frost comes and blue jays sing
the broken year will make no change
upon her wise and whirling heart
she knows how people always plan
to live their lives and never do
she will not tell me if she cries
i touch the crosses by her name
i fold the pages as i rise
and tip the envelope from which
drift scraps of borage woodbine rue
she steps into the dark swamp
where the long wait ends
the secret slippery package
drops to the weeds
she leans her long neck and tongues it
between breaths slack with exhaustion
and after a while it rises and becomes a creature
like her but much smaller
so now there are two and they walk together
like a dream under the trees
in early june at the edge of a field
thick with pink and yellow flowers
i meet them
i can only stare
she is the most beautiful woman
i have ever seen
her child leaps among the flowers
the blue of the sky falls over me
like silk the flowers burn and i want
to live my life all over again to begin again
to be utterly
wild
my father for example
who was young once
and blue eyed
returns
on the darkest of nights
to the porch and knocks
wildly at the door
and if i answer
i must be prepared
for his waxy face
for his lower lip
swollen with bitterness
and so for a long time
i did not answer
but slept fitfully
between his hours of rapping
but finally there came the night
when i rose out of my sheets
and stumbled down the hall
the door fell open
and i knew i was saved
and could bear him
pathetic and hollow
with even the least of his dreams
frozen inside him
and the meanness gone
and i greeted him and asked him
into the house
and lit the lamp
and looked into his blank eyes
in which at last
i saw what a child must love
i saw what love might have done
had we loved in time
closing the book i find i have left my head
inside it is dark in here but the chapters open
their beautiful spaces and give a rustling sound
words adjusting themselves to their meaning
long passages open at successive pages an echo
continuous from the title onward hums
behind me from in here the world looms
a jungle redeemed by these linked sentences
carved out when an author traveled and a reader
kept the way open when this book ends
i will pull it inside out like a sock
and throw it back in the library but the rumor
of it will haunt all that follows in my life
a candleflame in tibet leans when i move
at blackwater pond the tossed waters have settled
after a night of rain
i dip my cupped hands i drink
a long time it tastes
like stone leaves fire it falls cold
into my body waking the bones i hear them
deep inside me whispering
oh what is that beautiful thing
that just happened
at great pond
the sun rising
scrapes his orange breast
on the thick pines
and down tumble
a few orange feathers into
the dark water
on the far shore
a white bird is standing
like a white candle
or a man in the distance
in the clasp of some meditation
while all around me the lilies
are breaking open again
from the black cave
of the night
later i will consider
what i have seen
what it could signify
what words of adoration i might
make of it and to do this
i will go indoors to my desk
i will sit in my chair
i will look back
into the lost morning
in which i am moving now
like a swimmer
so smoothly
so peacefully
i am almost the lily
almost the bird vanishing over the water
on its sleeves of night
when the blackberries hang
swollen in the woods in the brambles
nobody owns i spend
all day among the high
branches reaching
my ripped arms thinking
of nothing cramming
the black honey of summer
into my mouth all day my body
accepts what it is in the dark
creeks that run by there is
this thick paw of my life darting among
the black bells the leaves there is
this happy tongue
needing one i invented her
the great great aunt dark as hickory
called shining leaf or drifting cloud
or the beauty of the night
dear aunt i d call into the leaves
and she d rise up like an old log in a pool
and whisper in a language only the two of us knew
the word that meant follow
and we d travel
cheerful as birds
out of the dusty town and into the trees
where she would change us both into something quicker
two foxes with black feet
two snakes green as ribbons
two shimmering fish and all day we d travel
at day s end she d leave me back at my own door
with the rest of my family
who were kind but solid as wood
and rarely wandered while she
old twist of feathers and birch bark
would walk in circles wide as rain and then
float back
scattering the rags of twilight
on fluttering moth wings
or she d slouch from the barn like a gray opossum
or she d hang in the milky moonlight
burning like a medallion
this bone dream this friend i had to have
this old woman made out of leaves
over the local stations one by one
announcers list disasters like dark poems
that always happen in the skull of winter
but once again the storm has passed us by
lovely and moderate the snow lies down
while shouting children hurry back to play
and scarved and smiling citizens once more
sweep down their easy paths of pride and welcome
and what else might we do les us be truthful
two counties north the storm has taken lives
two counties north to us is far away
a land of trees a wing upon a map
a wild place never visited so we
forget with ease each far mortality
peacefully from our frozen yards we watch
our children running on the mild white hills
this is the landscape that we understand
and till the principle of things takes root
how shall examples move us from our calm
i do not say that is not a fault
i only say except as we have loved
all news arrives as from a distant land
okay not one can write a symphony or a dictionary
or even a letter to an old friend full of remembrance
and comfort
not one can manage a single sound though the blue jays
carp and whistle all day in the branches without
the push of the wind
but to tell the truth after a while i m pale with longing
for their thick bodies ruckled with lichen
and you can t keep me from the woods from the tonnage
of their shoulders and their shining green hair
today is a day like any other twenty four hours a
little sunshine a little rain
listen says ambition nervously shifting her weight from
one boot to another why don t you get going
for there i am in the mossy shadows under the trees
and to tell the truth i don t want to let go of the wrists
of idleness i don t want to sell my life for money
i don t even want to come in out of the rain
in april
the ponds open
like black blossoms
the moon
swims in every one
there s fire
everywhere frogs shouting
their desire
their satisfaction what
we know that time
chops at us all like an iron
hoe that death
is a state of paralysis what
we long for joy
before death nights
in the swale everything else
can wait but not
this thrust
from the root
of the body what
we know we are more
than blood we are more
than our hunger and yet
we belong
to the moon and when the ponds
open when the burning
begins the most
thoughtful among us dreams
of hurrying down
into the black petals
into the fire
into the night where time lies shattered
into the body of another
i go down to the edge of the sea
how everything shines in the morning light
the cusp of the whelk
the broken cupboard of the clam
the opened blue mussels
moon snails pale pink and barnacle scarred
and nothing at all whole or shut but tattered split
dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone
it s like a schoolhouse
of little words
thousands of words
first you figure out what each one means by itself
the jingle the periwinkle the scallop
full of moonlight
then you begin slowly to read the whole story
he picks his pond and the soft thicket of his world
he bids his lady come and she does
flirting with her tail
he begins early and makes up his song as he goes
he does not enter a house at night or when it rains
he is not afraid of the wind though he is cautious
he watches the snake that stripe of black fire
until it flows away
he watches the hawk with her sharpest shins aloft
in the high tree
he keeps his prayer under his tongue
in his whole life he has never missed the rising of the sun
he dislikes snow
but a few raisins give him the greatest delight
he sits in the forelock of the lilac or he struts
in its shadow
he is neither the rare plover or the brilliant bunting
but as common as the grass
his black cap gives him a jaunty look for which
we humans have learned to tilt our caps in envy
when he is not singing he is listening
neither have i ever seen him with his eyes closed
though he may be looking at nothing more than a cloud
it brings to his mind several dozen new remarks
from one branch to another or across the path
he dazzles with flight
since i see him every morning i have rewarded myself
the pleasure of thinking that he knows me
yet never once has he answered my nod
he seems in fact to find in me a kind of humor
i am so vast uncertain and strange
i am the one who comes and goes
and who knows why
will i ever understand him
certainly he will never understand me or the world
i come from
for he will never sing for the kingdom of dollars
for he will never grow pockets in his gray wings
three miles through the woods
clapp s pond sprawls stone gray
among oaks and pines
the late winter fields
where a pheasant blazes up
lifting his yellow legs
under bronze feathers opening
bronze wings
and one doe dimpling the ground as she touches
its dampness sharply flares
out of the brush and gallops away
by evening rain
it pours down from the black clouds
lashes over the roof the last
acorns spray over the porch i toss
one then two more
logs on the fire
how sometimes everything
closes up a painted fan landscapes and moments
flowing together until the sense of distance
say between clapp s pond and me
vanishes edges slide together
like the feathers of a wing everything
touches everything
later lying half asleep under
the blankets i watch
while the doe glittering with rain steps
under the wet slabs of the pines stretches
her long neck down to drink
from the pond
three miles away
we enter
the green river
heron harbor
mud basin lined
with snagheaps where turtles
sun themselves we push
through the falling
silky weight
striped warm and cold
bounding down
through the black flanks
of wet rocks we wade
under hemlock
and white pine climb
stone steps into
the timeless castles
of emerald eddies
swirls channels
cold as ice tumbling
out of a white flow
sheer sheets
flying off rocks
frivolous and lustrous
skirting the secret pools
cradles
full of the yellow hair
of last year s leaves
where grizzled fish
hang halfway down
like tarnished swords
while around them
fingerlings sparkle
and descend
nails of light
in the loose
racing waters
cold now
close to the edge almost
unbearable clouds
bunch up and boil down
from the north of the white bear
this tree splitting morning
i dream of his fat tracks
the lifesaving suet
i think of summer with its luminous fruit
blossoms rounding to berries leaves
handfuls of grain
maybe what cold is is the time
we measure the love we have always had secretly
for our own bones the hard knife edged love
for the warm river of the i beyond all else maybe
that is what it means the beauty
of the blue shark cruising toward the tumbling seals
in the season of snow
in the immeasurable cold
we grow cruel but honest we keep
ourselves alive
if we can taking one after another
the necessary bodies of others the many
crushed red flowers
it is possible i suppose that sometime
we will learn everything
there is to learn what the world is for example
and what it means i think this as i am crossing
from one field to another in summer and the
mockingbird is mocking me as one who either
knows enough already or knows enough to be
perfectly content not knowing song being born
of quest he knows this he must turn silent
were he suddenly assaulted with answers instead
oh hear his wild caustic tender warbling ceaselessly
unanswered at my feet the white petalled daisies display
the small suns of their center piece their if you don t
mind my saying so their hearts of course
i could be wrong perhaps their hearts are pale and
narrow and hidden in the roots what do i know
but this it is heaven itself to take what is given
to see what is plain what the sun lights up willingly
for example i think this
as i reach down not to pick but merely to touch
the suitability of the field for the daisies and the
daisies for the field
some kind of relaxed and beautiful thing
kept flickering in with the tide
and looking around
black as a fisherman s boot
with a white belly
if you asked for a picture i would have to draw a smile
under the perfectly round eyes and above the chin
which was rough
as a thousand sharpened nails
and you know
what a smile means
don t you
i wanted the past to go away i wanted
to leave it like another country i wanted
my life to close and open
like a hinge like a wing like the part of the song
where it falls
down over the rocks an explosion a discovery
i wanted
to hurry into the work of my life i wanted to know
whoever i was i was
alive
for a little while
it was evening and no longer summer
three small fish i don t know what they were
huddled in the highest ripples
as it came swimming in again effortless the whole body
one gesture one black sleeve
that could fit easily around
the bodies of three small fish
also i wanted
to be able to love and we all know
how that one goes
don t we
slowly
the dogfish tore open the soft basins of water
you don t want to hear the story
of my life and anyway
i don t want to tell it i want to listen
to the enormous waterfalls of the sun
and anyway it s the same old story
a few people just trying
one way or another
to survive
mostly i want to be kind
and nobody of course is kind
or mean
for a simple reason
and nobody gets out of it having to
swim through the fires to stay in
this world
and look look look i think those little fish
better wake up and dash themselves away
from the hopeless future that is
bulging toward them
and probably
if they don t waste time
looking for an easier world
they can do it
where the path closed
down and over
through the scumbled leaves
fallen branches
through the knotted catbrier
i kept going finally
i could not
save my arms
from thorns soon
the mosquitoes
smelled me hot
and wounded and came
wheeling and whining
and that s how i came
to the edge of the pond
black and empty
except for a spindle
of bleached reeds
at the far shore
which as i looked
wrinkled suddenly
into three egrets
a shower
of white fire
even half asleep they had
such faith in the world
that had made them
tilting through the water
unruffled sure
by the laws
of their faith not logic
they opened their wings
softly and stepped
over every dark thing
another year gone leaving everywhere
its rich spiced residues vines leaves
the uneaten fruits crumbling damply
in the shadows unmattering back
from the particular island
of this summer this now that now is nowhere
except underfoot moldering
in that black subterranean castle
of unobservable mysteries roots and sealed seeds
and the wanderings of water this
i try to remember when time s measure
painfully chafes for instance when autumn
flares out at the last boisterous and like us longing
to stay how everything lives shifting
from one bright vision to another forever
in these momentary pastures
welcome to the silly comforting poem
it is not the sunrise
which is a red rinse
which is flaring all over the eastern sky
it is not the rain falling out of the purse of god
it is not the blue helmet of the sky afterward
or the trees or the beetle burrowing into the earth
it is not the mockingbird who in his own cadence
will go on sizzling and clapping
from the branches of the catalpa that are thick with blossoms
that are billowing and shining
that are shaking in the wind
you still recall sometimes the old barn on your
great grandfather s farm a place you visited once
and went into all alone while the grownups sat and
talked in the house
it was empty or almost wisps of hay covered the floor
and some wasps sang at the windows and maybe there was
a strange fluttering bird high above disturbed hoo ing
a little and staring down from a messy ledge with wild
binocular eyes
mostly though it smelled of milk and the patience of
animals the give offs of the body were still in the air
a vague ammonia not unpleasant
mostly though it was restful and secret the roof high
up and arched the boards unpainted and plain
you could have stayed there forever a small child in a corner
on the last raft of hay dazzled by so much space that seemed
empty but wasn t
then you still remember you felt the rap of hunger it was
noon and you turned from that twilight dream and hurried back
to the house where the table was set where an uncle patted you
on the shoulder for welcome and there was your place at the table
nothing lasts
there is a graveyard where everything i am talking about is
now
i stood there once on the green grass scattering flowers
nothing is so delicate or so finely hinged as the wings
of the green moth
against the lantern
against its heat
against the beak of the crow
in the early morning
yet the moth has trim and feistiness and not a drop
of self pity
not in this world
my mother
was the blue wisteria
my mother
was the mossy stream out behind the house
my mother alas alas
did not always love her life
heavier than iron it was
as she carried it in her arms from room to room
oh unforgettable
i bury her
in a box
in the earth
and turn away
my father
was a demon of frustrated dreams
was a breaker of trust
was a poor thin boy with bad luck
he followed god there being no one else
he could talk to
he swaggered before god there being no one else
who would listen
listen
this was his life
i bury it in the earth
i sweep the closets
i leave the house
i mention them now
i will not mention them again
it is not lack of love
nor lack of sorrow
but the iron thing they carried i will not carry
i give them one two three four the kiss of courtesy
of sweet thanks
of anger of good luck in the deep earth
may they sleep well may they soften
but i will not give them the kiss of complicity
i will not give them the responsibility for my life
did you know that the ant has a tongue
with which to gather in all that it can
of sweetness
did you know that
the poem is not the world
it isn t even the first page of the world
but the poem wants to flower like a flower
it knows that much
it wants to open itself
like the door of a little temple
so that you might step inside and be cooled and refreshed
and less yourself than part of everything
the voice of the child crying out of the mouth of the
grown woman
is a misery and a disappointment
the voice of the child howling out of the tall bearded
muscular man
is a misery and a terror
therefore tell me
what will engage you
what will open the dark fields of your mind
like a lover
at first touching
anyway
there was no barn
no child in the barn
no uncle no table no kitchen
only a long lovely field full of bobolinks
when loneliness comes stalking go into the fields consider
the orderliness of the world notice
something you have never noticed before
like the tambourine sound of the snow cricket
whose pale green body is no longer than your thumb
stare hard at the hummingbird in the summer rain
shaking the water sparks from its wings
let grief be your sister she will whether or no
rise up from the stump of sorrow and be green also
like the diligent leaves
a lifetime isn t long enough for the beauty of this world
and the responsibilities of your life
scatter your flowers over the graves and walk away
be good natured and untidy in your exuberance
in the glare of your mind be modest
and beholden to what is tactile and thrilling
live with the beetle and the wind
this is the dark bread of the poem
this is the dark and nourishing bread of the poem
i am watching the white gannets
blaze down into the water
with the power of blunt spears
and a stunning accuracy
even though the sea is riled and boiling
and gray with fog
and the fish
are nowhere to be seen
they fall they explode into the water
like white gloves
then they vanish
then they climb out again
from the cliff of the wave
like white flowers
and still i think
that nothing in this world moves
but as a positive power
even the fish finning down into the current
or collapsing
in the red purse of the beak
are only interrupted from their own pursuit
of whatever it is
that fills their bellies
and i say
life is real
and pain is real
but death is an imposter
and if i could be what once i was
like the wolf or the bear
standing on the cold shore
i would still see it
how the fish simply escape this time
or how they slide down into a black fire
for a moment
then rise from the water inseparable
from the gannets wings
have you ever tried to enter the long black branches of other lives
tried to imagine what the crisp fringes full of honey hanging
from the branches of the young locust trees in early morning feel like
do you think this world was only an entertainment for you
never to enter the sea and notice how the water divides
with perfect courtesy to let you in
never to lie down on the grass as though you were the grass
never to leap to the air as you open your wings over the dark acorn of your heart
no wonder we hear in your mournful voice the complaint
that something is missing from your life
who can open the door who does not reach for the latch
who can travel the miles who does not put one foot
in front of the other all attentive to what presents itself
continually
who will behold the inner chamber who has not observed
with admiration even with rapture the outer stone
well there is time left
fields everywhere invite you into them
and who will care who will chide you if you wander away
from wherever you are to look for your soul
quickly then get up put on your coat leave your desk
to put one s foot into the door of the grass which is
the mystery which is death as well as life and
not be afraid
to set one s foot in the door of death and be overcome
with amazement
to sit down in front of the weeds and imagine
god the ten fingered sailing out of his house of straw
nodding this way and that way to the flowers of the
present hour
to the song falling out of the mockingbird s pink mouth
to the tippets of the honeysuckle that have opened
in the night
to sit down like a weed among weeds and rustle in the wind
listen are you breathing just a little and calling it a life
while the soul after all is only a window
and the opening of the window no more difficult
than the wakening from a little sleep
only last week i went out among the thorns and said
to the wild roses
deny me not
but suffer my devotion
then all afternoon i sat among them maybe
i even heard a curl or tow of music damp and rouge red
hurrying from their stubby buds from their delicate watery bodies
for how long will you continue to listen to those dark shouters
caution and prudence
fall in fall in
a woman standing in the weeds
a small boat flounders in the deep waves and what s coming next
is coming with its own heave and grace
meanwhile once in a while i have chanced among the quick things
upon the immutable
what more could one ask
and i would touch the faces of the daises
and i would bow down
to think about it
that was then which hasn t ended yet
now the sun begins to swing down under the peach light
i cross the fields and the dunes i follow the ocean s edge
i climb i backtrack
i float
i ramble my way home
that time
i thought i could not
go any closer to grief
without dying
i went closer
and i did not die
surely god
had his hand in this
as well as friends
still i was bent
and my laughter
as the poet said
was nowhere to be found
then said my friend daniel
brave even among lions
it s not the weight you carry
but how you carry it
books bricks grief
it s all in the way
you embrace it balance it carry it
when you cannot and would not
put it down
so i went practicing
have you noticed
have you heard
the laughter
that comes now and again
out of my startled mouth
how i linger
to admire admire admire
the things of this world
that are kind and maybe
also troubled
roses in the wind
the sea geese on the steep waves
a love
to which there is no reply
so heavy
is the long necked long bodied heron
always it is a surprise
when her smoke colored wings
open
and she turns
from the thick water
from the black sticks
of the summer pond
and slowly
rises into the air
and is gone
then not for the first or the last time
i take the deep breath
of happiness and i think
how unlikely it is
that death is a hole in the ground
how improbable
that ascension is not possible
though everything seems so inert so nailed
back into itself
the muskrat and his lumpy lodge
the turtle
the fallen gate
and especially it is wonderful
that the summers are long
and the ponds so dark and so many
and therefore it isn t a miracle
but the common thing
this decision
this trailing of the long legs in the water
this opening up of the heavy body
into a new life see how the sudden
gray blue sheets of her wings
strive toward the wind see how the clasp of nothing
takes her in
it fills you with the soft
essence of vanished flowers it becomes
a trickle sharp as a hair that you follow
from the honey pot over the table
and out the door and over the ground
and all the while it thickens
grows deeper and wilder edged
with pine boughs and wet boulders
pawprints of bobcat and bear until
deep in the forest you
shuffle up some tree you rip the bark
you float into and swallow the dripping combs
bits of the tree crushed bees a taste
composed of everything lost in which everything lost is found
love love love says percy
and hurry as fast as you can
along the shining beach or the rubble or the dust
then go to sleep
give up your body heat your beating heart
then trust
i want to write something
so simply
about love
or about pain
that even
as you are reading
you feel it
and as you read
you keep feeling it
and though it be my story
it will be common
though it be singular
it will be known to you
so that by the end
you will think
no you will realize
that it was all the while
yourself arranging the words
that it was all the time
words that you yourself
out of your heart
had been saying
something
just now
moved through my heart
like the thinnest of blades
as that red tail pumped
once with its great wings
and flew above the gray cracked
rock wall
it wasn t
about the bird it was
something about the way
stone stays
mute and put whatever
goes flashing by
sometimes
when i sit like this quiet
all the dreams of my blood
and all outrageous divisions of time
seem ready to leave
to slide out of me
then i imagine i would never move
by now
the hawk has flown five miles
at least
dazzling whoever else has happened
to look up
i was dazzled but that
wasn t the knife
it was the sheer dense wall
of blind stone
without a pinch of hope
or a single unfulfilled desire
sponging up and reflecting
so brilliantly
as it has for centuries
the sun s fire
last night
the rain
spoke to me
slowly saying
what joy
to come falling
out of the brisk cloud
to be happy again
in a new way
on the earth
that s what it said
as it dropped
smelling of iron
and vanished
like a dream of the ocean
into the branches
and the grass below
then it was over
the sky cleared
i was standing
under a tree
the tree was a tree
with happy leaves
and i was myself
and there were stars in the sky
that were also themselves
at the moment
at which moment
my right hand
was holding my left hand
which was holding the tree
which was filled with stars
and the soft rain
imagine imagine
the long and wondrous journeys
still to be ours
the oaks shone
gaunt gold
on the lip
of the storm before
the wind rose
the shapeless mouth
opened and began
its five hour howl
the lights
went out fast branches
sidled over
the pitch of the roof bounced
into the year
that grew black
within minutes except
for the lightening the landscape
bulging forth like a quick
lesson in creating then
thudding away inside
as always
it was hard to tell
fear from excitement
how sensual
the lightning s
poured stroke and still
what a fire and a risk
as always the body
wants to hide
wants to flow toward it strives
to balance while
fear shouts
excitement shouts back
and forth each
bolt a burning river
tearing like escape through the dark
field of the other
i have been thinking
about living
like the lilies
that blow in the fields
they rise and fall
in the edge of the wind
and have no shelter
from the tongues of the cattle
and have no closets or cupboards
and have no legs
still i would like to be
as wonderful
as the old idea
but if i were a lily
i think i would wait all day
for the green face
of the hummingbird
to touch me
what i mean is
could i forget myself
even in those feathery fields
when van gogh
preached to the poor
of coarse he wanted to save someone
most of all himself
he wasn t a lily
and wandering through the bright fields
only gave him more ideas
it would take his life to solve
i think i will always be lonely
in this world where the cattle
graze like a black and white river
where the vanishing lilies
melt without protest on their tongues
where the hummingbird whenever there is a fuss
just rises and floats away
his beak could open a bottle
and his eyes when he lifts their soft lids
go on reading something
just beyond your shoulder
blake maybe
or the book of revelation
never mind that he eats only
the black smocked crickets
and the dragonflies if they happen
to be out late over the ponds and of course
the occasional festal mouse
never mind that he is only a memo
from the offices of fear
it s not size but surge that tells us
when we re in touch with something real
and when i hear him in the orchard
fluttering
down the little aliminum
ladder of his scream
when i see his wings open like two black ferns
a flurry of palpitations
as cold as sleet
rackets across the marshlands
of my heart
like a wild spring day
somewhere in the universe
in the gallery of important things
the babyish owl ruffled and rakish
sits on its pedestal
dear dark dapple of plush
a message reads the label
from that mysterious conglomerate
oblivion and co
the hooked head stares
from its house of dark feathery lace
it could be a valentine
every summer
i listen and look
under the sun s brass and even
into the moonlight but i can t hear
anything i can t see anything
not the pale roots digging down nor the green
stalks muscling up
nor the leaves
deepening their damp pleats
nor the tassels making
nor the shucks nor the cobs
and still
every day
the leafy fields
grow taller and thicker
green gowns lofting up in the night
showered with silk
and so every summer
i fail as a witness seeing nothing
i am deaf too
to the tick of the leaves
the tapping of downwardness from the banyan feet
all of it
happening
beyond any seeable proof or hearable hum
and therefore let the immeasurable come
let the unknowable touch the buckle of my spine
let the wind turn in the trees
and the mystery hidden in the dirt
swing through the air
how could i look at anything in this world
and tremble and grip my hands over my heart
what should i fear
one morning
in the leafy green ocean
the honeycomb of the corn s beautiful body
is sure to be there
out of the sump rise the marigolds
from the rim of the marsh muslin with mosquitoes
rises the egret in his cloud cloth
through the soft rain like mist and mica
the withered acres of moss begin again
when i have to die i would like to die
on a day of rain
long rain slow rain the kind you think will never end
and i would like to have whatever little ceremony there might be
take place while the rain is shoveled and shoveled out of the sky
and anyone who comes must travel slowly and with thought
as around the edges of the great swamp
every day
i see or hear
something
that more or less
kills me
with delight
that leaves me
like a needle
in the haystack
of light
it was what i was born for
to look to listen
to lose myself
inside this soft world
to instruct myself
over and over
in joy
and acclamation
nor am i talking
about the exceptional
the fearful the dreadful
the very extravagant
but of the ordinary
the common the very drab
the daily presentations
oh good scholar
i say to myself
how can you help
but grow wise
with such teachings
as these
the untrimmable light
of the world
the ocean s shine
the prayers that are made
out of grass
all my life
so far
i have loved
more than one thing
including the mossy hooves
of dreams including
the spongy litter
under the tall trees
in spring
the moccasin flowers
reach for the crackling
lick of the sun
and burn down sometimes
in the shadows
i see the hazy eyes
the lamb lips
of oblivion
its deep drowse
and i can imagine a new nothing
in the universe
the matted leaves splitting
open revealing
the black planks
of the stairs
but all my life sofar
i have loved best
how the flowers rise
and open how
the pink lungs of their bodies
enter the fore of the world
and stand there shining
and willing the one
thing they can do before
they shuffle forward
into the floor of darkness they
become the trees
this morning
two mockingbirds
in the green field
were spinning and tossing
the white ribbons
of their songs
into the air
i had nothing
better to do
than listen
i mean this
seriously
in greece
a long time ago
an old couple
opened their door
to two strangers
who were
it soon appeared
not men at all
but gods
it is my favorite story
how the old couple
had almost nothing to give
but their willingness
to be attentive
but for this alone
the gods loved them
and blessed them
when they rose
out of their mortal bodies
like a million particles of water
from a fountain
the light
swept into all the corners
of the cottage
and the old couple
shaken with understanding
bowed down
but still they asked for nothing
but the difficult life
which they had already
and the gods smiled as they vanished
clapping their great wings
wherever it was
i was supposed to be
this morning
whatever it was i said
i would be doing
i was standing
at the edge of the field
i was hurrying
through my own soul
opening its dark doors
i was leaning out
i was listening
under the leaves under
the first loose
levels of earth
they re there quick
as beetles blind
as bats shy
as hares but seen
less than these
traveling
among the pale girders
of appleroot
rockshelf nests
of insects and black
pastures of bulbs
peppery and packed full
of the sweetest food
spring flowers
field after field
you can see the traceries
of their long
lonely walks then
the rains blur
even this frail hint of them
so excitable
so plush
so willing to continue
generation after generation
accomplishing nothing
but their brief physical lives
as they live and die
pushing and shoving
with their stubborn muzzles against
the whole earth
finding it
delicious
blue and dark blue
rose and deepest rose
white and pink they
are everywhere in the diligent
cornfield rising and swaying
in their reliable
finery in the little
fling of their bodies their
gear and tackle
all caught up in the cornstalks
the reaper s story is the story
of endless work of
work careful and heavy but the
reaper cannot
separate them out there they
are in the story of his life
bright random useless
year after year
taken with the serious tons
weeds without value
humorous beautiful weeds
every morning
the world
is created
under the orange
sticks of the sun
the heaped
ashes of the night
turn into leaves again
and fasten themselves to the high branches
and the ponds appear
like black cloth
on which are painted islands
of summer lilies
if it is your nature
to be happy
you will swim away along the soft trails
for hours your imagination
alighting everywhere
and if your spirit
carries within it
the thorn
that is heavier than lead
if it s all you can do
to keep on trudging
there is still
somewhere deep within you
a beast shouting that the earth
is exactly what it wanted
each pond with its blazing lilies
is a prayer heard and answered
lavishly
every morning
whether or not
you have ever dared to be happy
whether or not
you have ever dared to pray
mushrooms
rain and then
the cool pursed
lips of the wind
draw them
out of the ground
red and yellow skulls
pummeling upward
through leaves
through grasses
through sand astonishing
in their suddenness
their quietude
their wetness they appear
on fall mornings some
balancing in the earth
on one hoof
packed with poison
others billowing
chunkily and delicious
those who know
walk out to gather choosing
the benign from flocks
of glitterers sorcerers
russulas
panther caps
shark white death angels
in their town veils
looking innocent as sugar
but full of paralysis
to eat
is to stagger down
fast as mushrooms themselves
when they are done being perfect
and overnight
slide back under the shining
fields of rain
i tied together
a few slender reeds cut
notches to breathe across and made
such music you stood
shock still and then
followed as i wandered growing
moment by moment
slant eyes and shaggy my feet
slamming over the rocks growing
hard as horn and there
you were behind me drowning
in the music letting
the silver clasps out of your hair
hurrying taking off
your clothes
i can t remember
where this happened but i think
it was late summer when everything
is full of fire and rounding to fruition
and whatever doesn t
or resists
must lie like a field of dark water under
the pulling moon
tossing and tossing
in the brutal elegance of cities
i have walked down
the halls of hotels
and heard this music behind
shut doors
do you think the heart
is accountable do you think the body
any more than a branch
of the honey locust tree
hunting water
hunching toward the sun
shivering when it feels
that good into
white blossoms
or do you think there is a kind
of music a certain strand
that lights up the otherwise
blunt wilderness of the body
a furious
and unaccountable selectivity
ah well anyway whether or not
it was late summer or even
in our part of the world it is all
only a dream i did not
turn into the lithe goat god nor did you come running
like that
did you
truly we live with mysteries too marvelous
to be understood
how grass can be nourishing in the
mouths of the lambs
how rivers and stones are forever
in allegiance with gravity
while we ourselves dream of rising
how two hands touch and the bonds will
never be broken
how people come from delight or the
scars of damage
to the comfort of a poem
let me keep my distance always from those
who think they have the answers
let me keep company always with those who say
look and laugh in astonishment
and bow their heads
next time what i d do is look at
the earth before saying anything i d stop
just before going into a house
and be an emperor for a minute
and listen better to the wind
or to the air being still
when anyone talked to me whether
blame or praise or just passing time
i d watch the face how the mouth
has to work and see any strain any
sign of what lifted the voice
and for all i d know more the earth
bracing itself and soaring the air
finding every leaf and feather over
forest and water and for every person
the body glowing inside the clothes
like a light
on winter s margin see the small birds now
with half forged memories come flocking home
to gardens famous for their charity
the green globe s broken vines like tangled veins
hang at the entrance to the silent wood
with half a loaf i am the prince of crumbs
by snow s down the birds amassed will sing
like children for their sire to walk abroad
but what i love is the gray stubborn hawk
who floats alone beyond the frozen vines
and what i dream of are the patient deer
who stand on legs like reeds and drink that wind
they are what saves the world who choose to grow
thin to a starting point beyond this squalor
the mosquito is so small
it takes almost nothing to ruin it
each leaf the same
and the black ant hurrying
so many lives so many fortunes
every morning i walk softly and with forward glances
down to the ponds and through the pinewoods
mushrooms even have but a brief hour
before the slug creeps to the feast
before the pine needles hustle down
under the bundles of harsh beneficent rain
how many how many how many
make up a world
and then i think of that old idea the singular
and the eternal
one cup in which everything is swirled
back to the color of the sea and sky
imagine it
a shining cup surely
in the moment in which there is no wind
over your shoulder
you stare down into it
and there you are
your own darling face your own eyes
and then the wind not thinking of you just passes by
touching the ant the mosquito the leaf
and you know what else
how blue is the sea how blue is the sky
how blue and tiny and redeemable everything is even you
even your eyes even your imagination
this morning the green fists of the peonies are getting ready
to break my heart
as the sun rises
as the sun strokes them with his old buttery fingers
and they open
pools of lace
white and pink
and all day the black ants climb over them
boring their deep and mysterious holes
into the curls
craving the sweet sap
taking it away
to their dark underground cities
and all day
under the shifty wind
as in a dance to the great wedding
the flowers bend their bright bodies
and tip their fragrance to the air
and rise
their red stems holding
all that dampness and recklessness
gladly and lightly
and there it is again
beauty the brave the exemplary
blazing open
do you love this world
do you cherish your humble and silky life
do you adore the green grass with its terror beneath
do you also hurry half dressed and barefoot into the garden
and softly
and exclaiming of their dearness
fill your arms with the white and pink flowers
with their honeyed heaviness their lush trembling
their eagerness
to be wild and perfect for a moment before they are
nothing forever
once in summer
in the blueberries
i fell asleep and woke
when a deer stumbled against me
i guess
she was so busy with her own happiness
she had grown careless
and was just wandering along
listening
to the wind as she leaned down
to lip up the sweetness
so there we were
with nothing between us
but a few leaves and wind s
glossy voice
shouting instructions
the deer
backed away finally
and flung up her white tail
and went floating off toward the trees
but the moment she did that
was so wide and so deep
it has lasted to this day
i have only to think of her
the flower of her amazement
and the stalled breath of her curiosity
and even the damp touch of her solicitude
before she took flight
to be absent again from this world
and alive again in another
for thirty years
sleepy and amazed
rising out of the rough weeds
listening and looking
beautiful girl
where are you
the spirit
likes to dress up like this
ten fingers
ten toes
shoulders and all the rest
at night
in the black branches
in the morning
in the blue branches
of the world
it could float of course
but would rather
plumb rough matter
airy and shapeless thing
it needs
the metaphor of the body
lime and appetite
the oceanic fluids
it needs the body s world
instinct
and imagination
and the dark hug of time
sweetness
and tangibility
to be understood
to be more than pure light
that burns
where no one is
so it enters us
in the morning
shines from brute comfort
like a stitch of lightning
and at night
lights up the deep and wondrous
drownings of the body
like a star
the poppies send up their
orange flares swaying
in the wind their congregations
are a levitation
of bright dust of thin
and lacy leaves
there isn t a place
in this world that doesn t
sooner or later drown
in the indigos of darkness
but now for a while
the roughage
shines like a miracle
as it floats above everything
with its yellow hair
of course nothing stops the cold
black curved blade
from hooking forward
of course
loss is the great lesson
but i also say this that light
is an invitation
to happiness
and that happiness
when it s done right
is a kind of holiness
palpable and redemptive
inside the bright fields
touched by their rough and spongy gold
i am washed and washed
in the river
of earthly delight
and what are you going to do
what can you do
about it
deep blue night
it doesn t have to be
the blue iris it could be
weeds in a vacant lot or a few
small stones just
pay attention then patch
a few words together and don t try
to make them elaborate this isn t
a contest but the doorway
into thanks and a silence in which
another voice may speak
today again i am hardly myself
it happens over and over
it is heaven sent
it flows through me
like the blue wave
green leaves you may believe this or not
have once or twice
emerged from the tips of my fingers
somewhere
deep in the woods
in the reckless seizure of spring
though of course i also know that other song
the sweet passion of one ness
just yesterday i watched an ant crossing a path through the
tumbled pine needles she toiled
and i thought she will never live another life but this one
and i thought if she lives her life with all her strength
is she not wonderful and wise
and i continued this up the miraculous pyramid of everything
until i came to myself
and still even in these northern woods on these hills of sand
i have flown from the other window of myself
to become white heron blue whale
red fox hedgehog
oh sometimes already my body has felt like the body of a flower
sometimes already my heart is a red parrot perched
among strange dark trees flapping and screaming
what men build in the name of security is built of straw
does the grain of sand know it is a grain of sand
my dog ben a mouth like a tabernacle
you can have the other words chance luck coincidence
serendipity i ll take grace i don t know what it is exactly but
i ll take it
the pine cone has secrets it will never tell
myself myself myself that darling hut
how quick it will burn
death listens
to the hum and strike of my words
his laughter spills
spring there rises up from the earth such a blazing sweetness
it fills you thank god with disorder
i am a performing artist i perform admiration
come with me i want my poems to say and do the same
in singapore in the airport
a darkness was ripped from my eyes
in the women s restroom one compartment stood open
a woman knelt there washing something
in the white bowl
disgust argued in my stomach
and i felt in my pocket for my ticket
a poem should always have birds in it
kingfishers say with their bold eyes and gaudy wings
rivers are pleasant and of course trees
a waterfall or if that s not possible a fountain
rising and falling
a person wants to stand in a happy place in a poem
when the woman turned i could not answer her face
her beauty and her embarrassment struggled together and
neither could win
she smiled and i smiled what kind of nonsense is this
everybody needs a job
yes a person wants to stand in a happy place in a poem
but first we must watch her as she stares down at her labor
which is dull enough
she is washing the tops of the airport ashtrays as big as
hubcaps with a blue rag
her small hands turn the metal scrubbing and rinsing
she does not work slowly nor quickly but like a river
her dark hair is like the wing of a bird
i don t doubt for a moment that she loves her life
and i want her to rise up from the crust and the slop
and fly down to the river
this probably won t happen
but maybe it will
if the world were only pain and logic who would want it
of course it isn t
neither do i mean anything miraculous but only
the light that can shine out of a life i mean
the way she unfolded and refolded the blue cloth
the way her smile was only for my sake i mean
the way this poem is filled with trees and birds
and now as the iron rinds over
the ponds start dissolving
you come dreaming of ferns and flowers
and new leaves unfolding
upon the brash
turnip hearted skunk cabbage
slinging its bunches leaves up
through the chilling mud
you kneel beside it the smell
is lurid and flows out in the most
unabashed way attracting
into itself a continual spattering
of protein appalling its rough
green caves and the thought
of the thick root nested below stubborn
and powerful as instinct
but these are the woods you love
where the secret name
of every death is life again a miracle
wrought surely not of mere turning
but of dense and scalding reenactment not
tenderness not longing but daring and brawn
pull down the frozen waterfall the past
ferns leaves flowers the last subtle
refinements elegant and easeful wait
to rise and flourish
what blazes the trail is not necessarily pretty
i thought the earth remembered me
she took me back so tenderly
arranging her dark skirts her pockets
full of lichens and seeds
i slept as never before a stone on the river bed
nothing between me and the white fire of the stars
but my thoughts and they floated light as moths
among the branches of the perfect trees
all night i heard the small kingdoms
breathing around me the insects
and the birds who do their work in the darkness
all night i rose and fell as if in water
grappling with a luminous doom by morning
i had vanished at least a dozen times
into something better
oh to love what is lovely and will not last
what a task
to ask
of anything or anyone
yet it is ours
and not by the century or the year but by the hours
one fall day i heard
above me and above the sting of the wind a sound
i did not know and my look shot upward it was
a flock of snow geese winging it
faster than the ones we usually see
and being the color of snow catching the sun
so they were in part at least golden i
held my breath
as we do
sometimes
to stop time
when something wonderful
has touched us
as with a match
which is lit and bright
but does not hurt
in the common way
but delightfully
as if delight
were the most serious thing
you ever felt
the geese
flew on
i have never seen them again
maybe i will someday somewhere
maybe i won t
it doesn t matter
what matters
is that when i saw them
i saw them
as through the veil secretly joyfully clearly
last night an owl
in the blue dark
tossed
an indeterminate number
of carefully shaped sounds into
the world in which
a quarter of a mile away i happened
to be standing
i couldn t tell
which one it was
the barred or the great horned
ship of the air
it was that distant but anyway
aren t there moments
that are better than knowing something
and sweeter snow was falling
so much like stars
filling the dark trees
that one could easily imagine
its reason for being was nothing more
than prettiness i suppose
if this were someone else s story
they would have insisted on knowing
whatever is knowable would have hurried
over the fields
to name it the owl i mean
but it s mine this poem of the night
and i just stood there listening and holding out
my hands to the soft glitter
falling through the air i love this world
but not for its answers
and i wish good luck to the owl
whatever its name
and i wish great welcome to the snow
whatever its severe and comfortless
and beautiful meaning
times in the morning early
when it rained and the long gray
buildings came forward from darkness
offering their windows for light
evenings out there on the plains
when sunset donated farms
that yearned so far to the west that the world
centered there and bowed down
a teacher at a country school
walking home past a great marsh
where ducks came gliding in
she saw the boy out hunting and waved
silence on a hill where the path ended
and then the forest below
moving in one long whisper
as evening touched the leaves
shelter in winter that day
a storm coming but in the lee
of an island in a cover with friends
oh little bright cup of sun
something came up
out of the dark
it wasn t anything i had ever seen before
it wasn t an animal
or a flower
unless it was both
something came up out of the water
a head the size of a cat
but muddy and without ears
i don t know what god is
i don t know what death is
but i believe they have between them
some fervent and necessary arrangement
sometime
melancholy leaves me breathless
water from the heavens electricity from the source
both of them mad to create something
the lighting brighter than any flower
the thunder without a drowsy bone in its body
instructions for living a life
pay attention
be astonished
tell about it
two or three times in my life i discovered love
each time it seemed to solve everything
each time it solved a great many things
but not everything
yet left me as grateful as if it had indeed and
thoroughly solved everything
god rest in my heart
and fortify me
take away my hunger for answers
let the hours play upon my body
like the hands of my beloved
let the cathead appear again
the smallest of your mysteries
some wild cousin of my own blood probably
some cousin of my own wild blood probably
in the black dinner bowl of the pond
death waits for me i know it around
one corner or another
this doesn t amuse me
neither does it frighten me
after the rain i went back into the field of sunflowers
it was cool and i was anything but drowsy
i walked slowly and listened
to the crazy roots in the drenched earth laughing and growing
on a summer morning
i sat down
on a hillside
to think about god
a worthy pastime
near me i saw
a single cricket
it was moving the grains of the hillside
this way and that way
how great was its energy
how humble its effort
let us hope
it will always be like this
each of us going on
in our inexplicable ways
building the universe
somewhere
a black bear
has just risen from sleep
and is staring
down the mountain
all night
in the brisk and shallow restlessness
of early spring
i think of her
her four black fists
flicking the gravel
her tongue
like a red fire
touching the grass
the cold water
there is only one question
how to love this world
i think of her
rising
like a black and leafy ledge
to sharpen her claws against
the silence
of the trees
whatever else
my life is
with its poems
and its music
and its glass cities
it is also this dazzling darkness
coming
down the mountain
breathing and tasting
all day i think of her
her white teeth
her wordlessness
her perfect love
i used to imagine him
coming from his house like merlin
strolling with important gestures
through the garden
where everything grows so thickly
where birds sing little snakes lie
on the boughs thinking of nothing
but their own good lives
where petals float upward
their colors exploding
and trees open their moist
pages of thunder
it has happened every summer for years
but now i know more
about the great wheel of growth
and decay and rebirth
and know my vision for a falsehood
now i see him coming from the house
i see him on his knees
cutting away the diseased the superfluous
coaxing the new
know that the hour of fulfillment
is buried in years of patience
yet willing to labor like that
on the mortal wheel
oh what good it does the heart
to know it isn t magic
like the human child i am
i rush to imitate
i watch him as he bends
among the leaves and vines
to hook some weed or other
i think of him there
raking and trimming stirring up
those sheets of fire
between the smothering weights of earth
the wild and shapeless air
chunky and noisy
but with stars in their black feathers
they spring from the telephone wire
and instantly
they are acrobats
in the freezing wind
and now in the theater of air
they swing over buildings
dipping and rising
they float like one stippled star
that opens
becomes for a moment fragmented
then closes again
and you watch
and you try
but you simply can t imagine
how they do it
with no articulated instruction no pause
only the silent confirmation
that they are this notable thing
this wheel of many parts that can rise and spin
over and over again
full of gorgeous life
ah world what lessons you prepare for us
even in the leafless winter
even in the ashy city
i am thinking now
of grief and of getting past it
i feel my boots
trying to leave the ground
i feel my heart
pumping hard i want
to think again of dangerous and noble things
i want to be light and frolicsome
i want to be improbable beautiful and afraid of nothing
as though i had wings
it was spring
and finally i heard him
among the first leaves
then i saw him clutching the limb
in an island of shade
with his red brown feathers
all trim and neat for the new year
first i stood still
and thought of nothing
then i began to listen
then i was filled with gladness
and that s when it happened
when i seemed to float
to be myself a wing or a tree
and i began to understand
what the bird was saying
and the sands in the glass
stopped
for a pure white moment
while gravity sprinkled upward
like rain rising
and in fact
it became difficult to tell just what it was that was singing
it was the thrush for sure but it seemed
not a single thrush but himself and all his brothers
and also the trees around them
as well as the gliding long tailed clouds
in the perfectly blue sky all all of them
were singing
and of course yes so it seemed
so was i
such soft and solemn and perfect music doesn t last
for more than a few moments
it s one of those magical places wise people
like to talk about
one of the things they say about it that is true
is that once you ve been there
you re there forever
listen everyone has a chance
is it spring is it morning
are there trees near you
and does your own soul need comforting
quick then open the door and fly on your heavy feet the song
may already be drifting away
you can
die for it
an idea
or the world people
have done so
brilliantly
letting
their small bodies be bound
to the stake
creating
an unforgettable
fury of light but
this morning
climbing the familiar hills
in the familiar
fabric of dawn i thought
of china
and india
and europe and i thought
how the sun
blazes
for everyone just
so joyfully
as it rises
under the lashes
of my own eyes and i thought
i am so many
what is my name
what is the name
of the deep breath i would take
over and over
for all of us call it
whatever you want it is
happiness it is another one
of the ways to enter
fire
that sweet flute john clare
that broken branch eddy whitman
christopher smart in the press of blazing electricity
my uncle the suicide
woolf on her way to the river
wolf of the sorrowful songs
swift impenetrable mask of dublin
schumann climbing the bridge leaping into the rhine
ruskin cowper
poe rambling in the gloom bins of baltimore and richmond
light of the world hold me
the arrowhead
which i found beside the river
was glittering and pointed
i picked it up and said
now it s mine
i thought of showing it to friends
i thought of putting it such an imposing trinket
in a little box on my desk
halfway home past the cut fields
the old ghost
stood under the hickories
i would rather drink the wind he said
i would rather eat mud and die
than steal as you steal
than lie as you lie
make of yourself a light
said the buddha
before he died
i think of this every morning
as the east begins
to tear off its many clouds
of darkness to send up the first
signal a white fan
streaked with pink and violet
even green
an old man he lay down
between two sala trees
and he might have said anything
knowing it was his final hour
the light burns upward
it thickens and settles over the fields
around him the villagers gathered
and stretched forward to listen
even before the sun itself
hangs disattached in the blue air
i am touched everywhere
by its ocean of yellow waves
no doubt he thought of everything
that had happened in his difficult life
and then i feel the sun itself
as it blazes over the hills
like a million flowers on fire
clearly i m not needed
yet i feel myself turning
into something of inexplicable value
slowly beneath the branches
he raised his head
he looked into the faces of that frightened crowd
all summer i made friends
with the creatures nearby
they flowed through the fields
and under the tent walls
or padded through the door
grinning through their many teeth
looking for seeds
suet sugar muttering and humming
opening the breadbox happiest when
there was milk and music but once
in the night i heard a sound
outside the door the canvas
bulged slightly something
was pressing inward at eye level
i watched trembling sure i had heard
the click of claws the smack of lips
outside my gauzy house
i imagined the red eyes
the broad tongue the enormous lap
would it be friendly too
fear defeated me and yet
not in faith and not in madness
but with the courage i thought
my dream deserved
i stepped outside it was gone
then i whirled at the sound of some
shambling tonnage
did i see a black haunch slipping
back through the trees did i see
the moonlight shining on it
did i actually reach out my arms
toward it toward paradise falling like
the fading of the dearest wildest hope
the dark heart of the story that is all
the reason for its telling
the dark things of the wood
are coming from their caves
flexing muscle
they browse the orchard
nibble the sea of grasses
around our yellow rooms
scarcely looking in
to see what we are doing
and if they still know us
we hear them or think we do
the muzzle lapping moonlight
the tooth in the apple
put another log on the fire
mozart again on the turntable
still there is a sorrow
with us in the room
we remember the cave
in our dreams we go back
or they come to visit
they also like music
we eat leaves together
they are our brothers
they are the family
we have run away from
the first fish
i ever caught
would not lie down
quiet in the pail
but flailed and sucked
at the burning
amazement of the air
and died
in the slow pouring off
of rainbows later
i opened his body and separated
the flesh from the bones
and ate him now the sea
is in me i am the fish the fish
glitters in me we are
risen tangled together certain to fall
back to the sea out of pain
and pain and more pain
we feed this feverish plot we are nourished
by the mystery
listen whatever it is you try
to do with your life nothing will ever dazzle you
like the dreams of your body
its spirit
longing to fly while the dead weight bones
toss their dark mane and hurry
back into the fields of glittering fire
where everything
even the great whale
throbs with song
one day you finally knew
what you had to do and began
though the voices around you
kept shouting
their bad advice
though the whole house
began to tremble
and you felt the old tug
at your ankles
mend my life
each voice cried
but you didn t stop
you knew what you had to do
though the wind pried
with its stiff fingers
at the very foundations
though their melancholy
was terrible
it was already late
enough and a wild night
and the road full of fallen
branches and stones
but little by little
as you left their voices behind
the stars began to burn
through the sheets of clouds
and there was a new voice
which you slowly
recognized as your own
that kept you company
as you strode deeper and deeper
into the world
determined to do
the only thing you could do
determined to save
the only life you could save
the kingfisher rises out of the black wave
like a blue flower in his beak
he carries a silver leaf i think this is
the prettiest world so long as you don t mind
a little dying how could there be a day in your
whole life
that doesn t have its splash of happiness
there are more fish than there are leaves
on a thousand trees and anyway the kingfisher
wasn t born to think about it or anything else
when the wave snaps shut over his blue head the
water
remains water hunger is the only story
he has ever heard in his life that he could
believe
i don t say he s right neither
do i say he s wrong religiously he swallows the
silver leaf
with its broken red river and with a rough and
easy cry
i couldn t rouse out of my thoughtful body
if my life depended on it he swings back
over the bright sea to do the same thing to do it
as i long to do something anything perfectly
in every heart there is a coward and a procrastinator
in every heart there is a god of flowers just waiting
to stride out of a cloud and lift its wings
the kookaburras pressed against the edge of their cage
asked me to open the door
years later i remember how i didn t do it
how instead i walked away
they had the brown eyes of soft hearted dogs
they didn t want to do anything so extraordinary only to fly
home to their river
by now i suppose the great darkness has covered them
as for myself i am not yet a god of even the palest flowers
nothing else has changed either
someone tosses their white bones to the dung heap
the sun shines on the latch of their cage
i lie in the dark my heart pounding
and i have seen
at dawn
the lark
spin out of the long grass
and into the pink air
its wings
which are neither wide
nor overstrong
fluttering
the pectorals
ploughing and flashing
for nothing but altitude
and the song
bursting
all the while
from the red throat
and then he descends
and is sorry
his little head hangs
and he pants for breath
for a few moments
among the hoops of the grass
which are crisp and dry
where most of his living is done
and then something summons him again
and up he goes
his shoulders working
his whole body almost collapsing and floating
to the edges of the world
we are reconciled i think
to too much
better to be a bird like this one
an ornament of the eternal
as he came down once to the nest of the grass
squander the day but save the soul
i heard him say
night after night
darkness
enters the face
of the lily
which lightly
closes its five walls
around itself
and its purse
of honey
and its fragrance
and is content
to stand there
in the garden
not quite sleeping
and maybe
saying in lily language
some small words
we can t hear
even when there is no wind
anywhere
its lips
are so secret
its tongue
is so hidden
or maybe
it says nothing at all
but just stands there
with the patience
of vegetables
and saints
until the whole earth has turned around
and the silver moon
becomes the golden sun
as the lily absolutely knew it would
which is itself isn t it
the perfect prayer
there s a kind of white moth i don t know
what kind that glimmers
by mid may
in the forest just
as the pink mocassin flowers
are rising
if you notice anything
it leads you to notice
more
and more
and anyway
i was so full of energy
i was always running around looking
at this and that
if i stopped
the pain
was unbearable
if i stopped and thought maybe
the world
can t be saved
the pain
was unbearable
finally i noticed enough
all around me in the forest
the white moths floated
how long do they live fluttering
in and out of the shadows
you aren t much i said
one day to my reflection
in a green pond
and grinned
the wings of the moths catch the sunlight
and burn
so brightly
at night sometimes
they slip between the pink lobes
of the moccasin flowers and lie there until dawn
motionless
in those dark halls of honey
wherever i am the world comes after me
it offers me its busyness it does not believe
that i do not want it now i understand
why the old poets of china went so far and high
into the mountains then crept into the pale mist
you want to cry aloud for your
mistakes but to tell the truth the world
doesn t need anymore of that sound
so if you re going to do it and can t
stop yourself if your pretty mouth can t
hold it in at least go by yourself across
the forty fields and the forty dark inclines
of rocks and water to the place where
the falls are flinging out their white sheets
like crazy and there is a cave behind all that
jubilation and water fun and you can
stand there under it and roar all you
want and nothing will be disturbed you can
drip with despair all afternoon and still
on a green branch its wings just lightly touched
by the passing foil of the water the thrush
puffing out its spotted breast will sing
of the perfect stone hard beauty of everything
every year
the lilies
are so perfect
i can hardly believe
their lapped light crowding
the black
mid summer ponds
nobody could count all of them
the muskrats swimming
among the pads and the grasses
can reach out
their muscular arms and touch
only so many they are that
rife and wild
but what in this world
is perfect
i bend closer and see
how this one is clearly lopsided
and that one wears an orange blight
and this one is a glossy cheek
half nibbled away
and that one is a slumped purse
full of its own
unstoppable decay
still what i want in my life
is to be willing
to be dazzled
to cast aside the weight of facts
and maybe even
to float a little
above this difficult world
i want to believe i am looking
into the white fire of a great mystery
i want to believe that the imperfections are nothing
that the light is everything that it is more than the sum
of each flawed blossom rising and fading and i do
all summer
i wandered the fields
that were thickening
every morning
every rainfall
with weeds and blossoms
with the long loops
of the shimmering and the extravagant
pale as flames they rose
and fell back
replete and beautiful
that was all there was
and i too
once or twice at least
felt myself rising
my boots
touching suddenly the tops of the weeds
the blue and silky air
listen
passion did it
called me forth
addled me
stripped me clean
then covered me with the cloth of happiness
i think there is no other prize
only rapture the gleaming
rapture the illogical the weightless
whether it be for the perfect shapeliness
of something you love
like an old german song
or of someone
or the dark floss of the earth itself
heavy and electric
at the edge of sweet sanity open
such wild blind wings
who made the world
who made the swan and the black bear
who made the grasshopper
this grasshopper i mean
the one who has flung herself out of the grass
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes
now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face
now she snaps her wings open and floats away
i don t know exactly what a prayer is
i do know how to pay attention how to fall down
into the grass how to kneel in the grass
how to be idle and blessed how to stroll through the fields
which is what i have been doing all day
tell me what else should i have done
doesn t everything die at last and too soon
tell me what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life
have you ever seen
anything
in your life
more wonderful
than the way the sun
every evening
relaxed and easy
floats toward the horizon
and into the clouds or the hills
or the rumpled sea
and is gone
and how it slides again
out of the blackness
every morning
on the other side of the world
like a red flower
streaming upward on its heavenly oils
say on a morning in early summer
at its perfect imperial distance
and have you ever felt for anything
such wild love
do you think there is anywhere in any language
a word billowing enough
for the pleasure
that fills you
as the sun
reaches out
as it warms you
as you stand there
empty handed
or have you too
turned from this world
or have you too
gone crazy
for power
for things
did you too see it drifting all night on the black river
did you see it in the morning rising into the silvery air
an armful of white blossoms
a perfect commotion of silk and linen as it leaned
into the bondage of its wings a snowbank a bank of lilies
biting the air with its black beak
did you hear it fluting and whistling
a shrill dark music like the rain pelting the trees like a waterfall
knifing down the black ledges
and did you see it finally just under the clouds
a white cross streaming across the sky its feet
like black leaves its wings like the stretching light of the river
and did you feel it in your heart how it pertained to everything
and have you too finally figured out what beauty is for
and have you changed your life
there s a bear in the truro woods
people have seen it three or four
or two or one i think
of the thickness of the serious woods
around the dark bowls of the truro ponds
i think of the blueberry fields the blackberry tangles
the cranberry bogs and the sky
with its new moon its familiar star trails
burns down like a brand new heaver
while everywhere i look on the scratchy hillsides
shadows seem to grow shoulders surely
a beast might be clever be lucky move quietly
through the woods for years learning to stay away
from roads and houses common sense mutters
it can t be true it must be somebody s
runaway dog but the seed
has been planted and when has happiness ever
required much evidence to begin
its leaf green breathing
i would like to write a poem about the world that has in it
nothing fancy
but it seems impossible
whatever the subject the morning sun
glimmers it
the tulip feels the heat and flaps its petals open and becomes a star
the ants bore into the peony bud and there is a dark
pinprick well of sweetness
as for the stones on the beach forget it
each one could be set in gold
so i tried with my eyes shut but of course the birds
were singing
and the aspen trees were shaking the sweetest music
out of their leaves
and that was followed by guess what a momentous and
beautiful silence
as comes to all of us in little earfuls if we re not too
hurried to hear it
as for spiders how the dew hangs in their webs
even if they say nothing or seem to say nothing
so fancy is the world who knows maybe they sing
so fancy is the world who knows maybe the stars sing too
and the ants and the peonies and the warm stones
so happy to be where they are on the beach instead of being
locked up in gold
we must begin to catch hold of everything
around us for nobody knows what we
may need we have to carry along
the air even and the weight we once
thought a burden turns out to form
the pulse of our life and the compass for our brain
colors balance our fears and existence
begins to clog unless our thoughts
can occur unwatched and let a fountain of essential silliness
out through our dreams
and oh i hope we can still arrange
for the wind to blow and occasionally
some kind of shock to occur like rain
and stray adventures no one cares about
harmless love immoderate guffaws on corners
families crawling around the front room growling
being bears in the piano cave
now i see it
it nudges with its bulldog head
the slippery stems of the lilies making them tremble
and now it noses along in the wake of the little brown teal
who is leading her soft children
from one side of the pond to the other she keeps
close to the edge
and they follow closely the good children
the tender children
the sweet children dangling their pretty feet
into the darkness
and now will come i can count on it the murky splash
the certain victory
of that pink and gassy mouth and the frantic
circling of the hen while the rest of the chicks
flare away over the water and into the reeds and my heart
will be most mournful
on their account but listen
what s important
nothing s important
except that the great and cruel mystery of the world
of which this is a part
not to be denied once
i happened to see on a city street in summer
a dusty fouled turtle plodded along
a snapper
broken out i suppose from some backyard cage
and i knew what i had to do
i looked it right in the eyes and i caught it
i put it like a small mountain range
into a knapsack and i took it out
of the city and i let it
down into the dark pond into
the cool water
and the light of the lilies
to live
last night the geese came back
slanting fast
from the blossom of the rising moon down
to the black pond a muskrat
swimming in the twilight saw them and hurried
to the secret lodges to tell everyone
spring had come
and so it had
by morning when i went out
the last of the ice had disappeared blackbirds
sang on the shores every year
the geese returning
do this i don t
know how
the curtains opened and there was
an old man in a headdress of feathers
leather leggings and a vest made
from the skin of some animal he danced
in a kind of surly rapture and the trees
in the fields far away
began to mutter and suck up their long roots
slowly they advanced until they stood
pressed to the schoolhouse windows
i don t know
lots of things but i know this next year
when spring
flows over the starting point i ll think i m going to
drown in the shimmering miles of it and then
one or two birds will fly me over
the threshold
as for the pain
of others of course it tries to be
abstract but then
there flares up out of a vanished wilderness like fire
still blistering the wrinkled face
of an old chippewa
smiling hating us
dancing for his life
what is so utterly invisible
as tomorrow
not love
not the wind
not the inside of a stone
not anything
and yet how often i m fooled
i m wading along
in the sunlight
and i m sure i can see the fields and the ponds shining
days ahead
i can see the light spilling
like a shower of meteors
into next week s trees
and i plan to be there soon
and so far i am
just that lucky
my legs splashing
over the edge of darkness
my heart on fire
i don t know where
such certainty comes from
the brave flesh
or the theater of the mind
but if i had to guess
i would say that only
what the soul is supposed to be
could send us forth
with such cheer
as even the leaf must wear
as it unfurls
its fragrant body and shines
against the hard possibility of stoppage
which day after day
before such brisk corpuscular belief
shudders and gives way
meditation is old and honorable so why should i
not sit every morning of my life on the hillside
looking into the shining world because properly
attended to delight as well as havoc is suggestion
can one be passionate about the just the
ideal the sublime and the holy and yet commit
to no labor in its cause i don t think so
all summations have a beginning all effect has a
story all kindness begins with the sown seed
thought buds toward radiance the gospel of
light is the crossroads of indolence or action
be ignited or be gone
when death comes
like the hungry bear in autumn
when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse
to buy me and snaps the purse shut
when death comes
like the measle pox
when death comes
like an iceberg between the shoulder blades
i want to step through the door full of curiosity wondering
what is it going to be like that cottage of darkness
and therefore i look upon everything
as a brotherhood and a sisterhood
and i look upon time as no more than an idea
and i consider eternity as another possibility
and i think of each life as a flower as common
as a field daisy and as singular
and each name a comfortable music in the mouth
tending as all music does toward silence
and each body a lion of courage and something
precious to the earth
when it s over i want to say all my life
i was a bride married to amazement
i was the bridegroom taking the world into my arms
when it s over i don t want to wonder
if i have made of my life something particular and real
i don t want to find myself sighing and frightened
or full of argument
i don t want to end up simply having visited this world
don t call this world adorable or useful that s not it
it s frisky and a theater for more than fair winds
the eyelash of lightning is neither good nor evil
the struck tree burns like a pillar of gold
but the blue rain sinks straight to the white
feet of the trees
whose mouths open
doesn t the wind turning in circles invent the dance
haven t the flowers moved slowly across asia then europe
until at last now they shine
in your own yard
don t call this world an explanation or even an education
when the sufi poet whirled was he looking
outward to the mountains so solidly there
in a white capped ring or was he looking
to the center of everything the seed the egg the idea
that was also there
beautiful as a thumb
curved and touching the finger tenderly
little love ring
as he whirled
oh jug of breath
in the garden of dust
all night
i float
in the shallow ponds
while the moon wanders
burning
bone white
among the milky stems
once
i saw her hand reach
to touch the muskrat s
small sleek head
and it was lovely oh
i don t want to argue anymore
about all the things
i thought i could not
live without soon
the muskrat
will glide with another
into their castle
of weeds morning
will rise from the east
tangled and brazen
and before that
difficult
and beautiful
hurricane of light
i want to flow out
across the mother
of all waters
i want to lose myself
on the black
and silky currents
yawning
gathering
the tall lilies
of sleep
bone
understand i am always trying to figure out
what the soul is
and where hidden
and what shape
and so last week
when i found on the beach
the ear bone
of a pilot whale that may have died
hundreds of years ago i thought
maybe i was close
to discovering something
for the ear bone
is the portion that lasts longest
in any of us man or whale shaped
like a squat spoon
with a pink scoop where
once in the lively swimmer s head
it joined its two sisters
in the house of hearing
it was only
two inches long
and thought the soul
might be like this
so hard so necessary
yet almost nothing
beside me
the gray sea
was opening and shutting its wave doors
unfolding over and over
its time ridiculing roar
i looked but i couldn t see anything
through its dark knit glare
yet don t we all know the golden sand
is there at the bottom
though our eyes have never seen it
nor can our hands ever catch it
lest we would sift it down
into fractions and facts
certainties
and what the soul is also
i believe i will never quite know
though i play at the edges of knowing
truly i know
our part is not knowing
but looking and touching and loving
which is the way i walked on
softly
through the pale pink morning light
you do not have to be good
you do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting
you only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves
tell me about despair yours and i will tell you mine
meanwhile the world goes on
meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes
over the prairies and the deep trees
the mountains and the rivers
meanwhile the wild geese high in the clean blue air
are heading home again
whoever you are no matter how lonely
the world offers itself to your imagination
calls to you like the wild geese harsh and exciting
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things
how necessary it is to have opinions i think the spotted trout
lilies are satisfied standing a few inches above the earth i
think serenity is not something you just find in the world
like a plum tree holding up its white petals
the violets along the river are opening their blue faces like
small dark lanterns
the green mosses being so many are as good as brawny
how important it is to walk along not in haste but slowly
looking at everything and calling out
yes no the
swan for all his pomp his robes of grass and petals wants
only to be allowed to live on the nameless pond the catbrier
is without fault the water thrushes down among the sloppy
rocks are going crazy with happiness imagination is better
than a sharp instrument to pay attention this is our endless
and proper work
my dog has died
i buried him in the garden
next to a rusted old machine
some day i ll join him right there
but now he s gone with his shaggy coat
his bad manners and his cold nose
and i the materialist who never believed
in any promised heaven in the sky
for any human being
i believe in a heaven i ll never enter
yes i believe in a heaven for all dogdom
where my dog waits for my arrival
waving his fan like tail in friendship
ai i ll not speak of sadness here on earth
of having lost a companion
who was never servile
his friendship for me like that of a porcupine
withholding its authority
was the friendship of a star aloof
with no more intimacy than was called for
with no exaggerations
he never climbed all over my clothes
filling me full of his hair or his mange
he never rubbed up against my knee
like other dogs obsessed with sex
no my dog used to gaze at me
paying me the attention i need
the attention required
to make a vain person like me understand
that being a dog he was wasting time
but with those eyes so much purer than mine
he d keep on gazing at me
with a look that reserved for me alone
all his sweet and shaggy life
always near me never troubling me
and asking nothing
ai how many times have i envied his tail
as we walked together on the shores of the sea
in the lonely winter of isla negra
where the wintering birds filled the sky
and my hairy dog was jumping about
full of the voltage of the sea s movement
my wandering dog sniffing away
with his golden tail held high
face to face with the ocean s spray
joyful joyful joyful
as only dogs know how to be happy
with only the autonomy
of their shameless spirit
there are no good byes for my dog who has died
and we don t now and never did lie to each other
so now he s gone and i buried him
and that s all there is to it
out of lemon flowers
loosed
on the moonlight love s
lashed and insatiable
essences
sodden with fragrance
the lemon tree s yellow
emerges
the lemons
move down
from the tree s planetarium
delicate merchandise
the harbors are big with it
bazaars
for the light and the
barbarous gold
we open
the halves
of a miracle
and a clotting of acids
brims
into the starry
divisions
creation s
original juices
irreducible changeless
alive
so the freshness lives on
in a lemon
in the sweet smelling house of the rind
the proportions arcane and acerb
cutting the lemon
the knife
leaves a little cathedral
alcoves unguessed by the eye
that open acidulous glass
to the light topazes
riding the droplets
altars
aromatic facades
so while the hand
holds the cut of the lemon
half a world
on a trencher
the gold of the universe
wells
to your touch
a cup yellow
with miracles
a breast and a nipple
perfuming the earth
a flashing made fruitage
the diminutive fire of a planet
the memory of you emerges from the night around me
the river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea
deserted like the dwarves at dawn
it is the hour of departure oh deserted one
cold flower heads are raining over my heart
oh pit of debris fierce cave of the shipwrecked
in you the wars and the flights accumulated
from you the wings of the song birds rose
you swallowed everything like distance
like the sea like time in you everything sank
it was the happy hour of assault and the kiss
the hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse
pilot s dread fury of blind driver
turbulent drunkenness of love in you everything sank
in the childhood of mist my soul winged and wounded
lost discoverer in you everything sank
you girdled sorrow you clung to desire
sadness stunned you in you everything sank
i made the wall of shadow draw back
beyond desire and act i walked on
oh flesh my own flesh woman whom i loved and lost
i summon you in the moist hour i raise my song to you
like a jar you housed infinite tenderness
and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar
there was the black solitude of the islands
and there woman of love your arms took me in
there was thirst and hunger and you were the fruit
there were grief and ruins and you were the miracle
ah woman i do not know how you could contain me
in the earth of your soul in the cross of your arms
how terrible and brief my desire was to you
how difficult and drunken how tensed and avid
cemetery of kisses there is still fire in your tombs
still the fruited boughs burn pecked at by birds
oh the bitten mouth oh the kissed limbs
oh the hungering teeth oh the entwined bodies
oh the mad coupling of hope and force
in which we merged and despaired
and the tenderness light as water and as flour
and the word scarcely begun on the lips
this was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing
and in it my longing fell in you everything sank
oh pit of debris everything fell into you
what sorrow did you not express in what sorrow are you not drowned
from billow to billow you still called and sang
standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel
you still flowered in songs you still brike the currents
oh pit of debris open and bitter well
pale blind diver luckless slinger
lost discoverer in you everything sank
it is the hour of departure the hard cold hour
which the night fastens to all the timetables
the rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore
cold stars heave up black birds migrate
deserted like the wharves at dawn
only tremulous shadow twists in my hands
oh farther than everything oh farther than everything
it is the hour of departure oh abandoned one
i have scarcely left you
when you go in me crystalline
or trembling
or uneasy wounded by me
or overwhelmed with love as
when your eyes
close upon the gift of life
that without cease i give you
my love
we have found each other
thirsty and we have
drunk up all the water and the
blood
we found each other
hungry
and we bit each other
as fire bites
leaving wounds in us
but wait for me
keep for me your sweetness
i will give you too
a rose
i am not jealous
of what came before me
come with a man
on your shoulders
come with a hundred men in your hair
come with a thousand men between your breasts and your feet
come like a river
full of drowned men
which flows down to the wild sea
to the eternal surf to time
bring them all
to where i am waiting for you
we shall always be alone
we shall always be you and i
alone on earth
to start our life
and because love battles
not only in its burning agricultures
but also in the mouth of men and women
i will finish off by taking the path away
to those who between my chest and your fragrance
want to interpose their obscure plant
about me nothing worse
they will tell you my love
than what i told you
i lived in the prairies
before i got to know you
and i did not wait love but i was
laying in wait for and i jumped on the rose
what more can they tell you
i am neither good nor bad but a man
and they will then associate the danger
of my life which you know
and which with your passion you shared
and good this danger
is danger of love of complete love
for all life
for all lives
and if this love brings us
the death and the prisons
i am sure that your big eyes
as when i kiss them
will then close with pride
into double pride love
with your pride and my pride
but to my ears they will come before
to wear down the tour
of the sweet and hard love which binds us
and they will say the one
you love
is not a woman for you
why do you love her i think
you could find one more beautiful
more serious more deep
more other you understand me look how she s light
and what a head she has
and look at how she dresses
and etcetera and etcetera
and i in these lines say
like this i want you love
love like this i love you
as you dress
and how your hair lifts up
and how your mouth smiles
light as the water
of the spring upon the pure stones
like this i love you beloved
to bread i do not ask to teach me
but only not to lack during every day of life
i don t know anything about light from where
it comes nor where it goes
i only want the light to light up
i do not ask to the night
explanations
i wait for it and it envelops me
and so you bread and light
and shadow are
you came to my life
with what you were bringing
made
of light and bread and shadow i expected you
and like this i need you
like this i love you
and to those who want to hear tomorrow
that which i will not tell them let them read it here
and let them back off today because it is early
for these arguments
tomorrow we will only give them
a leaf of the tree of our love a leaf
which will fall on the earth
like if it had been made by our lips
like a kiss which falls
from our invincible heights
to show the fire and the tenderness
of a true love
it was passed from one bird to another
the whole gift of the day
the day went from flute to flute
went dressed in vegetation
in flights which opened a tunnel
through the wind would pass
to where birds were breaking open
the dense blue air
and there night came in
when i returned from so many journeys
i stayed suspended and green
between sun and geography
i saw how wings worked
how perfumes are transmitted
by feathery telegraph
and from above i saw the path
the springs and the roof tiles
the fishermen at their trades
the trousers of the foam
i saw it all from my green sky
i had no more alphabet
than the swallows in their courses
the tiny shining water
of the small bird on fire
which dances out of the pollen
brown and agile child the sun which forms the fruit
and ripens the grain and twists the seaweed
has made your happy body and your luminous eyes
and given your mouth the smile of water
a black and anguished sun is entangled in the twigs
of your black mane when you hold out your arms
you play in the sun as in a tidal river
and it leaves two dark pools in your eyes
brown and agile child nothing draws me to you
everything pulls away from me here in the noon
you are the delirious youth of bee
the drunkedness of the wave the power of the heat
my somber heart seeks you always
i love your happy body your rich soft voice
dusky butterfly sweet and sure
like the wheat field the sun the poppy and the water
carnal apple woman filled burning moon
dark smell of seaweed crush of mud and light
what secret knowledge is clasped between your pillars
what primal night does man touch with his senses
ay love is a journey through waters and stars
through suffocating air sharp tempests of grain
love is a war of lightning
and two bodies ruined by a single sweetness
kiss by kiss i cover your tiny infinity
your margins your rivers your diminutive villages
and a genital fire transformed by delight
slips through the narrow channels of blood
to precipitate a nocturnal carnation
to be and be nothing but light in the dark
castro alves from brazil for whom did you sing
did you sing for the flower for the water
whose beauty whispered words to the stones
did you sing to the eyes to the torn profile
of the woman you once loved for the spring
yes but those petals were not dewed
those black waters had no words
those eyes were those who saw death
still burning the tortures behind love
spring was splashed with blood
i sang for the slaves aboard the ships
as a dark branch of wrath
they travelled and bled from the ships
leaving us the weight of a stolen blood
i sang in those days against the inferno
against the sharp languages of greed
against the gold drenched in the torment
against the hand that rose the whip
against the maestros of darkness
each rose had one dead man in their roots
the light the night the sky were covered in tears
the eyes separated from wounded hands
and it was my voice the only one to fill the silence
i wanted that from the man we could be rescued
i believed that the route passed through the man
and from there destiny would be made
i sang for those who had no voice
my voice hit doors that until then were closed
so that fighting freedom could be let in
castro alves from brazil now that your pure book
is reborn to a free land
let me poet of our america
to crown your head with the laurels of the people
your voice joined the eternal and loud voice of the men
you sang well you sang how it must be sung
how neatly a cat sleeps
sleeps with its paws and its posture
sleeps with its wicked claws
and with its unfeeling blood
sleeps with all the rings a series
of burnt circles which have formed
the odd geology of its sand colored tail
i should like to sleep like a cat
with all the fur of time
with a tongue rough as flint
with the dry sex of fire and
after speaking to no one
stretch myself over the world
over roofs and landscapes
with a passionate desire
to hunt the rats in my dreams
i have seen how the cat asleep
would undulate how the night flowed
through it like dark water and at times
it was going to fall or possibly
plunge into the bare deserted snowdrifts
sometimes it grew so much in sleep
like a tiger s great grandfather
and would leap in the darkness over
rooftops clouds and volcanoes
sleep sleep cat of the night with
episcopal ceremony and your stone carved moustache
take care of all our dreams
control the obscurity
of our slumbering prowess
with your relentless heart
and the great ruff of your tail
we have lost even this twilight
no one saw us this evening hand in hand
while the blue night dropped on the world
i have seen from my window
the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops
sometimes a piece of sun
burned like a coin in my hand
i remembered you with my soul clenched
in that sadness of mine that you know
where were you then
who else was there
saying what
why will the whole of love come on me suddenly
when i am sad and feel you are far away
the book fell that always closed at twilight
and my blue sweater rolled like a hurt dog at my feet
always always you recede through the evenings
toward the twilight erasing statues
come with me i said and no one knew
where or how my pain throbbed
no carnations or barcaroles for me
only a wound that love had opened
i said it again come with me as if i were dying
and no one saw the moon that bled in my mouth
or the blood that rose into the silence
o love now we can forget the star that has such thorns
that is why when i heard your voice repeat
come with me it was as if you had let loose
the grief the love the fury of a cork trapped wine
the geysers flooding from deep in its vault
in my mouth i felt the taste of fire again
of blood and carnations of rock and scald
there are lone cemeteries
tombs full of soundless bones
the heart threading a tunnel
a dark dark tunnel
like a wreck we die to the very core
as if drowning at the heart
or collapsing inwards from skin to soul
there are corpses
clammy slabs for feet
there is death in the bones
like a pure sound
a bark without its dog
out of certain bells certain tombs
swelling in this humidity like lament or rain
i see when alone at times
coffins under sail
setting out with the pale dead women in their dead braids
bakers as white as angels
thoughtful girls married to notaries
coffins ascending the vertical river of the dead
the wine dark river to its source
with their sails swollen with the sound of death
filled with the silent noise of death
death is drawn to sound
like a slipper without a foot a suit without its wearer
comes to knock with a ring stoneless and fingerless
comes to shout without a mouth a tongue without a throat
nevertheless its footsteps sound
and its clothes echo hushed like a tree
i do not know i am ignorant i hardly see
but it seems to me that its song has the colour of wet violets
violets well used to the earth
since the face of death is green
and the gaze of death green
with the etched moisture of a violet s leaf
and its grave colour of exasperated winter
but death goes about the earth also riding a broom
lapping the ground in search of the dead
death is in the broom
it is the tongue of death looking for the dead
the needle of death looking for the thread
death lies in our beds
in the lazy mattresses the black blankets
lives a full stretch and then suddenly blows
blows sound unknown filling out the sheets
and there are beds sailing into a harbour
where death is waiting dressed as an admiral
don t go far off not even for a day because
because i don t know how to say it a day is long
and i will be waiting for you as in an empty station
when the trains are parked off somewhere else asleep
don t leave me even for an hour because
then the little drops of anguish will all run together
the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift
into me choking my lost heart
oh may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach
may your eyelids never flutter into the empty distance
don t leave me for a second my dearest
because in that moment you ll have gone so far
i ll wander mazily over all the earth asking
will you come back will you leave me here dying
drunk as drunk on turpentine
from your open kisses
your wet body wedged
between my wet body and the strake
of our boat that is made of flowers
feasted we guide it our fingers
like tallows adorned with yellow metal
over the sky s hot rim
the day s last breath in our sails
pinned by the sun between solstice
and equinox drowsy and tangled together
we drifted for months and woke
with the bitter taste of land on our lips
eyelids all sticky and we longed for lime
and the sound of a rope
lowering a bucket down its well then
we came by night to the fortunate isles
and lay like fish
under the net of our kisses
victory it has come late i had not learnt
how to arrive like the lily at will
the white figure that pierces
the motionless eternity of earth
pushing at clear faint form
till the hour strikes that clay
with a white ray or a spur of milk
shedding of clothing the thick darkness of soil
on whose cliff the fair flower advances
till the flag of its whiteness
defeats the contemptible deep of night
and from the motion of light
spills itself in astonished seed
you ve asked me what the lobster is weaving there with
his golden feet
i reply the ocean knows this
you say what is the ascidia waiting for in its transparent
bell what is it waiting for
i tell you it is waiting for time like you
you ask me whom the macrocystis alga hugs in its arms
study study it at a certain hour in a certain sea i know
you question me about the wicked tusk of the narwhal
and i reply by describing
how the sea unicorn with the harpoon in it dies
you enquire about the kingfisher s feathers
which tremble in the pure springs of the southern tides
or you ve found in the cards a new question touching on
the crystal architecture
of the sea anemone and you ll deal that to me now
you want to understand the electric nature of the ocean
spines
the armored stalactite that breaks as it walks
the hook of the angler fish the music stretched out
in the deep places like a thread in the water
i want to tell you the ocean knows this that life in its
jewel boxes
is endless as the sand impossible to count pure
and among the blood colored grapes time has made the
petal
hard and shiny made the jellyfish full of light
and untied its knot letting its musical threads fall
from a horn of plenty made of infinite mother of pearl
i am nothing but the empty net which has gone on ahead
of human eyes dead in those darknesses
of fingers accustomed to the triangle longitudes
on the timid globe of an orange
i walked around as you do investigating
the endless star
and in my net during the night i woke up naked
the only thing caught a fish trapped inside the wind
beloved of the rivers beset
by azure water and transparent drops
like a tree of veins your spectre
of dark goddess biting apples
and then awakening naked
to be tattoed by the rivers
and in the wet heights your head
filled the world with new dew
water rose to your waist
you are made of wellsprings
and lakes shone on your forehead
from your sources of density you drew
water like vital tears
and hauled the riverbeds to the sand
across the planetary night
crossing rough dilated stone
breaking down on the way
all the salt of geology
cutting through forests of compact walls
dislodging the muscles of quartz
all those men were there inside
when she came in totally naked
they had been drinking they began to spit
newly come from the river she knew nothing
she was a mermaid who had lost her way
the insults flowed down her gleaming flesh
obscenities drowned her golden breasts
not knowing tears she did not weep tears
not knowing clothes she did not have clothes
they blackened her with burnt corks and cigarette stubs
and rolled around laughing on the tavern floor
she did not speak because she had no speech
her eyes were the colour of distant love
her twin arms were made of white topaz
her lips moved silent in a coral light
and suddenly she went out by that door
entering the river she was cleaned
shining like a white stone in the rain
and without looking back she swam again
swam towards emptiness swam towards death
matilde years or days
sleeping feverish
here or there
gazing off
twisting my spine
bleeding true blood
perhaps i awaken
or am lost sleeping
hospital beds foreign windows
white uniforms of the silent walkers
the clumsiness of feet
and then these journeys
and my sea of renewal
your head on the pillow
your hands floating
in the light in my light
over my earth
it was beautiful to live
when you lived
the world is bluer and of the earth
at night when i sleep
enormous within your small hands
fleas interest me so much
that i let them bite me for hours
they are perfect ancient sanskrit
machines that admit of no appeal
they do not bite to eat
they bite only to jump
they are the dancers of the celestial sphere
delicate acrobats
in the softest and most profound circus
let them gallop on my skin
divulge their emotions
amuse themselves with my blood
but someone should introduce them to me
i want to know them closely
i want to know what to rely on
rise up to be born with me brother
give me your hand from the deep
zone seeded by your sorrow
you won t return from under the rocks
you won t return from your subterranean time
your hardened voice won t return
your gouged out eyes won t return
look at me from the depth of the earth
laborer weaver silent shepherd
tamer of wild llamas like spirit images
construction worker on a daring scaffold
waterer of the tears of the andes
jeweler with broken fingers
farmer trembling as you sow
potter poured out into your clay
bring to the cup of this new life
your old buried sorrows
show me your blood and your furrow
tell me here i was punished
because the jewel didn t shine or the earth
didn t yield grain or stones on time
show me the stone you fell over
and the wood on which they crucified you
make a spark from the old flints for me
for the old lamps to show the whips still stuck
after centuries in the old wounds
and the axes shining with blood
i come to speak for your dead mouth
across the earth come together all
the silent worn out lips
and from the depth speak to me all this long night
like i was pinned down there with you
tell me all chain by chain
link by link and step by step
sharpen the knives which you hid
put them in my breast and in my hand
like a river of yellow lighting
like a river of buried jaguars
and let me weep hours days years
for blind ages cycles of stars
give me silence water hope
give me struggle iron volcanoes
stick bodies to me like magnets
draw near to my veins and my mouth
speak through my words and my blood
the names of god and especially those of his representative
who is called jesus or christ according to holy books and
someone s mouth
these names have been used worn out and left
on the shores of rivers of of human lives
like the empty shells of a mollusk
however when we touch these sacred but exhausted
names these wounded scattered petals
which have come out of the oceans of love and fear
something still remains a sip of water
a rainbow footprint that still shimmers in the light
while the names of god were used
by the best and the worst by the clean and the dirty
by the white and the black by bloody murderers
and by victims flaming gold with napalm
while nixon with his hands
of cain blessed those whom he condemned to death
while fewer and fewer divine footprints were found
on the beach
people began to study colors
the future of honey the sign of uranium
they looked with anxiety and hope for the possibilities
of killing themselves or not killing themselves of organizing
themselves into a fabric
of going further on of breaking through limits without stopping
what we came across in these blood thirsty times
with their smoke of burning trash their dead ashes
as we weren t able to stop looking
we often stopped to look at the names of god
we lifted them with tenderness because they reminded us
of our ancestors of the first people those who said the prayers
those who discovered the hymn that united them in misfortune
and now seeing the empty fragments which sheltered those
ancient people
we feel those smooth substances
worn out and used up by good and by evil
the young maricones and the horny muchachas
the big fat widows delirious from insomnia
the young wives thirty hours pregnant
and the hoarse tomcats that cross my garden at night
like a collar of palpitating sexual oysters
surround my solitary home
enemies of my soul
conspirators in pajamas
who exchange deep kisses for passwords
radiant summer brings out the lovers
in melancholy regiments
fat and thin and happy and sad couples
under the elegant coconut palms near the ocean and moon
there is a continual life of pants and panties
a hum from the fondling of silk stockings
and women s breasts that glisten like eyes
the salary man after a while
after the week s tedium and the novels read in bed at night
has decisively fucked his neighbor
and now takes her to the miserable movies
where the heroes are horses or passionate princes
and he caresses her legs covered with sweet down
with his ardent and sweaty palms that smell like cigarettes
the night of the hunter and the night of the husband
come together like bed sheets and bury me
and the hours after lunch when the students and priests are masturbating
and the animals mount each other openly
and the bees smell of blood and the flies buzz cholerically
and cousins play strange games with cousins
and doctors glower at the husband of the young patient
and the early morning in which the professor without a thought
pays his conjugal debt and eats breakfast
and to top it all off the adulterers who love each other truly
on beds big and tall as ships
so eternally
this twisted and breathing forest crushes me
with gigantic flowers like mouth and teeth
and black roots like fingernails and shoes
here i love you
in the dark pines the wind disentangles itself
the moon glows like phosphorous on the vagrant waters
days all one kind go chasing each other
the snow unfurls in dancing figures
a silver gull slips down from the west
sometimes a sail high high stars
oh the black cross of a ship
alone
sometimes i get up early and even my soul is wet
far away the sea sounds and resounds
this is a port
here i love you
here i love you and the horizon hides you in vain
i love you still among these cold things
sometimes my kisses go on those heavy vessels
that cross the sea towards no arrival
i see myself forgotten like those old anchors
the piers sadden when the afternoon moors there
my life grows tired hungry to no purpose
i love what i do not have you are so far
my loathing wrestles with the slow twilights
but night comes and starts to sing to me
the moon turns its clockwork dream
the biggest stars look at me with your eyes
and as i love you the pines in the wind
want to sing your name with their leaves of wire
don t go far off not even for a day
don t go far off not even for a day because
because i don t know how to say it a day is long
and i will be waiting for you as in an empty station
when the trains are parked off somewhere else asleep
don t leave me even for an hour because
then the little drops of anguish will all run together
the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift
into me choking my lost heart
oh may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach
may your eyelids never flutter into the empty distance
don t leave me for a second my dearest
because in that moment you ll have gone so far
i ll wander mazily over all the earth asking
will you come back will you leave me here dying
email

i do not love you except because i love you
i go from loving to not loving you
from waiting to not waiting for you
my heart moves from cold to fire
i love you only because it s you the one i love
i hate you deeply and hating you
bend to you and the measure of my changing love for you
is that i do not see you but love you blindly
maybe january light will consume
my heart with its cruel
ray stealing my key to true calm
in this part of the story i am the one who
dies the only one and i will die of love because i love you
because i love you love in fire and blood
you are going to ask and where are the lilacs
and the poppy petalled metaphysics
and the rain repeatedly spattering
its words and drilling them full
of apertures and birds
i ll tell you all the news
i lived in a suburb
a suburb of madrid with bells
and clocks and trees
from there you could look out
over castille s dry face
a leather ocean
my house was called
the house of flowers because in every cranny
geraniums burst it was
a good looking house
with its dogs and children
remember raul
eh rafel federico do you remember
from under the ground
my balconies on which
the light of june drowned flowers in your mouth
brother my brother
everything
loud with big voices the salt of merchandises
pile ups of palpitating bread
the stalls of my suburb of arguelles with its statue
like a drained inkwell in a swirl of hake
oil flowed into spoons
a deep baying
of feet and hands swelled in the streets
metres litres the sharp
measure of life
stacked up fish
the texture of roofs with a cold sun in which
the weather vane falters
the fine frenzied ivory of potatoes
wave on wave of tomatoes rolling down the sea
and one morning all that was burning
one morning the bonfires
leapt out of the earth
devouring human beings
and from then on fire
gunpowder from then on
and from then on blood
bandits with planes and moors
bandits with finger rings and duchesses
bandits with black friars spattering blessings
came through the sky to kill children
and the blood of children ran through the streets
without fuss like children s blood
jackals that the jackals would despise
stones that the dry thistle would bite on and spit out
vipers that the vipers would abominate
face to face with you i have seen the blood
of spain tower like a tide
to drown you in one wave
of pride and knives
treacherous
generals
see my dead house
look at broken spain
from every house burning metal flows
instead of flowers
from every socket of spain
spain emerges
and from every dead child a rifle with eyes
and from every crime bullets are born
which will one day find
the bull s eye of your hearts
and you ll ask why doesn t his poetry
speak of dreams and leaves
and the great volcanoes of his native land
come and see the blood in the streets
come and see
the blood in the streets
come and see the blood
in the streets
i like for you to be still
it is as though you are absent
and you hear me from far away
and my voice does not touch you
it seems as though your eyes had flown away
and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
as all things are filled with my soul
you emerge from the things
filled with my soul
you are like my soul
a butterfly of dream
and you are like the word melancholy
i like for you to be still
and you seem far away
it sounds as though you are lamenting
a butterfly cooing like a dove
and you hear me from far away
and my voice does not reach you
let me come to be still in your silence
and let me talk to you with your silence
that is bright as a lamp
simple as a ring
you are like the night
with its stillness and constellations
your silence is that of a star
as remote and candid
i like for you to be still
it is as though you are absent
distant and full of sorrow
so you would ve died
one word then one smile is enough
and i m happy
happy that it s not true
i like you calm as if you were absent
and you hear me far off and my voice does not touch you
it seems that your eyelids have taken to flying
it seems that a kiss has sealed up your mouth
since all these things are filled with my spirit
you come from things filled with my spirit
you appear as my soul as the butterfly s dreaming
and you appear as sadness s word
i like you calm as if you were distant
you are a moaning a butterfly s cooing
you hear me far off my voice does not reach you
let me be calmed then calmed by your silence
let me commune then commune with your silence
clear as a light and pure as a ring
you are like night calmed constellated
your silence is star like as distant as true
i like you calm as if you were absent
distant and saddened as if you were dead
one word at that moment a smile is sufficient
and i thrill then i thrill that it cannot be so
xv from veinte poemas de amor
i like you calm as if you were absent
and you hear me far off and my voice does not touch you
it seems that your eyelids have taken to flying
it seems that a kiss has sealed up your mouth
since all these things are filled with my spirit
you come from things filled with my spirit
you appear as my soul as the butterfly s dreaming
and you appear as sadness s word
i like you calm as if you were distant
you are a moaning a butterfly s cooing
you hear me far off my voice does not reach you
let me be calmed then calmed by your silence
let me commune then commune with your silence
clear as a light and pure as a ring
you are like night calmed constellated
your silence is star like as distant as true
i like you calm as if you were absent
distant and saddened as if you were dead
one word at that moment a smile is sufficient
and i thrill then i thrill that it cannot be so
i remember you as you were in the last autumn
you were the grey beret and the still heart
in your eyes the flames of the twilight fought on
and the leaves fell in the water of your soul
clasping my arms like a climbing plant
the leaves garnered your voice that was slow and at peace
bonfire of awe in which my thirst was burning
sweet blue hyacinth twisted over my soul
i feel your eyes traveling and the autumn is far off
grey beret voice of a bird heart like a house
towards which my deep longings migrated
and my kisses fell happy as embers
sky from a ship field from the hills
your memory is made of light of smoke of a still pond
beyond your eyes farther on the evenings were blazing
dry autumn leaves revolved in your soul
in my sky at twilight you are like a cloud
and your form and colour are the way i love them
you are mine mine woman with sweet lips
and in your life my infinite dreams live
the lamp of my soul dyes your feet
the sour wine is sweeter on your lips
oh reaper of my evening song
how solitary dreams believe you to be mine
you are mine mine i go shouting it to the afternoon s
wind and the wind hauls on my widowed voice
huntress of the depth of my eyes your plunder
stills your nocturnal regard as though it were water
you are taken in the net of my music my love
and my nets of music are wide as the sky
my soul is born on the shore of your eyes of mourning
in your eyes of mourning the land of dreams begin
in the wave strike over unquiet stones
the brightness bursts and bears the rose
and the ring of water contracts to a cluster
to one drop of azure brine that falls
o magnolia radiance breaking in spume
magnetic voyager whose death flowers
and returns eternal to being and nothingness
shattered brine dazzling leap of the ocean
merged you and i my love seal the silence
while the sea destroys its continual forms
collapses its turrets of wildness and whiteness
because in the weft of those unseen garments
of headlong water and perpetual sand
we bear the sole relentless tenderness
little
rose
roselet
at times
tiny and naked
it seems
as though you would fit
in one of my hands
as though i ll clasp you like this
and carry you to my mouth
but
suddenly
my feet touch your feet and my mouth your lips
you have grown
your shoulders rise like two hills
your breasts wander over my breast
my arm scarcely manages to encircle the thin
new moon line of your waist
in love you loosened yourself like sea water
i can scarcely measure the sky s most spacious eyes
and i lean down to your mouth to kiss the earth
it s good to feel you are close to me in the night love
invisible in your sleep intently nocturnal
while i untangle my worries
as if they were twisted nets
withdrawn your heart sails through dream
but your body relinquished so breathes
seeking me without seeing me perfecting my dream
like a plant that seeds itself in the dark
rising you will be that other alive in the dawn
but from the frontiers lost in the night
from the presence and the absence where we meet ourselves
something remains drawing us into the light of life
as if the sign of the shadows had sealed
its secret creatures with flame
leaning into the afternoons
i cast my sad nets towards your oceanic eyes
there in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames
its arms turning like a drowning man s
i send out red signals across your absent eyes
that wave like the sea or the beach by a lighthouse
you keep only darkness my distant female
from your regard sometimes the coast of dread emerges
leaning into the afternoons
i fling my sad nets to that sea that is thrashed
by your oceanic eyes
the birds of night peck at the first stars
that flash like my soul when i love you
the night gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land
leave me a place underground a labyrinth
where i can go when i wish to turn
without eyes without touch
in the void to dumb stone
or the finger of shadow
i know that you cannot no one no thing
can deliver up that place or that path
but what can i do with my pitiful passions
if they are no use on the surface
of everyday life
if i cannot look to survive
except by dying going beyond entering
into the state metallic and slumbering
of primeval flame
the gay young men and the love sick girls
and the abandoned widows suffering in sleepless delirium
and the young pregnant wives of thirty hours
and the raucous cats that cruise my garden in the shadows
like a necklace of pulsating oysters of sex
surround my lonely residence
like enemies lined up against my soul
like conspirators in bedroom clothes
who exchange long deep kisses to order
the radiant summer leads to lovers
in predictable melancholic regiments
made of fat and skinny sad and happy pairings
under the elegant coconut palms near the ocean and the moon
goes an endless movement of trousers and dresses
a whisper of silk stockings being caressed
and womens breasts that sparkle like eyes
the little employee after it all
after the weeks boredom and novels read by night in bed
has definitively seduced the girl next door
and carried her away to a run down movie house
where the heroes are studs or princes mad with passion
and strokes her legs covered with soft down
with his moist and ardent hands that smell of cigarettes
the seducers afternoons and married peoples nights
come together like the sheets and bury me
and the hours after lunch when the young male students
and the young girl students and the priests masturbate
and the creatures fornicate outright
and the bees smell of blood and the flies madly buzz
and boy and girl cousins play oddly together
and doctors stare in fury at the young patients husband
and the morning hours in which the professor as if to pass the time
performs his marriage duties and breakfasts
and moreover the adulterers who love each other truly
on beds as high and deep as ocean liners
finally eternally surrounding me
is a gigantic forest breathing and tangled
with gigantic flowers like mouths with teeth
and black roots in the shape of hooves and shoes
lost in the forest i broke off a dark twig
and lifted its whisper to my thirsty lips
maybe it was the voice of the rain crying
a cracked bell or a torn heart
something from far off it seemed
deep and secret to me hidden by the earth
a shout muffled by huge autumns
by the moist half open darkness of the leaves
wakening from the dreaming forest there the hazel sprig
sang under my tongue its drifting fragrance
climbed up through my conscious mind
as if suddenly the roots i had left behind
cried out to me the land i had lost with my childhood
and i stopped wounded by the wandering scent
what s wrong with you with us
what s happening to us
ah our love is a harsh cord
that binds us wounding us
and if we want
to leave our wound
to separate
it makes a new knot for us and condemns us
to drain our blood and burn together
what s wrong with you i look at you
and i find nothing in you but two eyes
like all eyes a mouth
lost among a thousand mouths that i have kissed more beautiful
a body just like those that have slipped
beneath my body without leaving any memory
and how empty you went through the world
like a wheat colored jar
without air without sound without substance
i vainly sought in you
depth for my arms
that dig without cease beneath the earth
beneath your skin beneath your eyes
nothing
beneath your double breast scarcely
raised
a current of crystalline order
that does not know why it flows singing
why why why
my love why
i do not love you as if you were a salt rose or topaz
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off
i love you as certain dark things are to be loved
in secret between the shadow and the soul
i love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance
risen from the earth lives darkly in my body
i love you without knowing how or when or from where
i love you straightforwardly without complexities or pride
so i love you because i know no other way
than this where i does not exist nor you
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand
so close that your eyes close as i fall asleep
love we re going home now
where the vines clamber over the trellis
even before you the summer will arrive
on its honeysuckle feet in your bedroom
our nomadic kisses wandered over all the world
armenia dollop of disinterred honey
ceylon green dove and the yangtse with its old
old patience dividing the day from the night
and now dearest we return across the crackling sea
like two blind birds to their wall
to their nest in a distant spring
because love cannot always fly without resting
our lives return to the wall to the rocks of the sea
our kisses head back home where they belong
lovely one
just as on the cool stone
of the spring the water
opens a wide flash of foam
so is the smile of your face
lovely one
lovely one
with delicate hands and slender feet
like a silver pony
walking flower of the world
thus i see you
lovely one
lovely one
with a nest of copper entangled
on your head a nest
the colour of dark honey
where my heart burns and rests
lovely one
lovely one
your eyes are too big for your face
your eyes are too big for the earth
there are countries there are rivers
in your eyes
my country is your eyes
i walk through them
they light the world
through which i walk
lovely one
lovely one
your breasts are like two loaves made
of grainy earth and golden moon
lovely one
lovely one
your waist
my arm shaped it like a river when
it flowed a thousand years through your sweet body
lovely one
lovely one
there is nothing like your hips
perhaps earth has
in some hidden place
the curve and the fragrance of your body
perhaps in some place
lovely one
lovely one my lovely one
your voice your skin your nails
lovely one my lovely one
your being your light your shadow
lovely one
all that is mine lovely one
all that is mine my dear
when you walk or rest
when you sing or sleep
when you suffer or dream
always
when you are near or far
always
you are mine my lovely one
always
luminous mind bright devil
of absolute clusterings of upright noon
here we are at last alone without loneliness
far from the savage city s delirium
just as a pure line describes the dove s curve
as the fire honors and nourishes peace
so you and i made this heavenly outcome
the mind and love live naked in this house
furious dreams rivers of bitter certainty
decisions harder than the dreams of a hammer
flowed into the lovers double cup
until those twins were lifted into balance
on the scale the mind and love like two wings
so this transparency was built
one time more my love the net of light extinguishes
work wheels flames boredoms and farewells
and we surrender the swaying wheat to night
the wheat that noon stole from earth and light
the moon alone in the midst of its clear page
sustains the pillars of heaven s bay
the room acquires the slowness of gold
and your hands go here and there preparing night
o love o night o cupola ringed by a river
of impenetrable water in the shadows of heaven
that raises and drowns its tempestuous orbs
until we are only the one dark space
a glass into which fall celestial ashes
one drop in the flow of a vast slow river
neither clown nor child nor black
nor white but verticle
and a questioning innocence
dressed in night and snow
the mother smiles at the sailor
the fisherman at the astronaunt
but the child child does not smile
when he looks at the bird child
and from the disorderly ocean
the immaculate passenger
emerges in snowy mourning
i was without doubt the child bird
there in the cold archipelagoes
when it looked at me with its eyes
with its ancient ocean eyes
it had neither arms nor wings
but hard little oars
on its sides
it was as old as the salt
the age of moving water
and it looked at me from its age
since then i know i do not exist
i am a worm in the sand
the reasons for my respect
remained in the sand
the religious bird
did not need to fly
did not need to sing
and through its form was visible
its wild soul bled salt
as if a vein from the bitter sea
had been broken
penguin static traveler
deliberate priest of the cold
i salute your vertical salt
and envy your plumed pride
march days return with their covert light
and huge fish swim through the sky
vague earthly vapours progress in secret
things slip to silence one by one
through fortuity at this crisis of errant skies
you reunite the lives of the sea to that of fire
grey lurchings of the ship of winter
to the form that love carved in the guitar
o love o rose soaked by mermaids and spume
dancing flame that climbs the invisible stairway
to waken the blood in insomnia s labyrinth
so that the waves can complete themselves in the sky
the sea forget its cargoes and rages
and the world fall into darkness s nets
naked you are simple as one of your hands
smooth earthy small transparent round
you ve moon lines apple pathways
naked you are slender as a naked grain of wheat
naked you are blue as a night in cuba
you ve vines and stars in your hair
naked you are spacious and yellow
as summer in a golden church
naked you are tiny as one of your nails
curved subtle rosy till the day is born
and you withdraw to the underground world
as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores
your clear light dims gets dressed drops its leaves
and becomes a naked hand again
there are cemeteries that are lonely
graves full of bones that do not make a sound
the heart moving through a tunnel
in it darkness darkness darkness
like a shipwreck we die going into ourselves
as though we were drowning inside our hearts
as though we lived falling out of the skin into the soul
and there are corpses
feet made of cold and sticky clay
death is inside the bones
like a barking where there are no dogs
coming out from bells somewhere from graves somewhere
growing in the damp air like tears of rain
sometimes i see alone
coffins under sail
embarking with the pale dead with women that have dead hair
with bakers who are as white as angels
and pensive young girls married to notary publics
caskets sailing up the vertical river of the dead
the river of dark purple
moving upstream with sails filled out by the sound of death
filled by the sound of death which is silence
death arrives among all that sound
like a shoe with no foot in it like a suit with no man in it
comes and knocks using a ring with no stone in it with no
finger in it
comes and shouts with no mouth with no tongue with no
throat
nevertheless its steps can be heard
and its clothing makes a hushed sound like a tree
i m not sure i understand only a little i can hardly see
but it seems to me that its singing has the color of damp violets
of violets that are at home in the earth
because the face of death is green
and the look death gives is green
with the penetrating dampness of a violet leaf
and the somber color of embittered winter
but death also goes through the world dressed as a broom
lapping the floor looking for dead bodies
death is inside the broom
the broom is the tongue of death looking for corpses
it is the needle of death looking for thread
death is inside the folding cots
it spends its life sleeping on the slow mattresses
in the black blankets and suddenly breathes out
it blows out a mournful sound that swells the sheets
and the beds go sailing toward a port
where death is waiting dressed like an admiral
there are cemeteries that are lonely
graves full of bones that do not make a sound
the heart moving through a tunnel
in it darkness darkness darkness
like a shipwreck we die going into ourselves
as though we were drowning inside our hearts
as though we lived falling out of the skin into the soul
and there are corpses
feet made of cold and sticky clay
death is inside the bones
like a barking where there are no dogs
coming out from bells somewhere from graves somewhere
growing in the damp air like tears of rain
sometimes i see alone

embarking with the pale dead with women that have dead hair
with bakers who are as white as angels

translated by robert bly
from bristly foliage
you fell
complete polished wood gleaming mahogany
as perfect
as a violin newly
born of the treetops
that falling
offers its sealed in gifts
the hidden sweetness
that grew in secret
amid birds and leaves
a model of form
kin to wood and flour
an oval instrument
that holds within it
intact delight an edible rose
in the heights you abandoned
the sea urchin burr
that parted its spines
in the light of the chestnut tree
through that slit
you glimpsed the world
birds
bursting with syllables
starry
dew
below
the heads of boys
and girls
grasses stirring restlessly
smoke rising rising
you made your decision
chestnut and leaped to earth
burnished and ready
firm and smooth
as the small breasts
of the islands of america
you fell
you struck
the ground
but
nothing happened
the grass
still stirred the old
chestnut sighed with the mouths
of a forest of trees
a red leaf of autumn fell
resolutely the hours marched on
across the earth
because you are
only
a seed
chestnut tree autumn earth
water heights silence
prepared the germ
the floury density
the maternal eyelids
that buried will again
open toward the heights
the simple majesty of foliage
the dark damp plan
of new roots
the ancient but new dimensions
of another chestnut tree in the earth
among the market greens
a bullet
from the ocean
depths
a swimming
projectile
i saw you
dead
all around you
were lettuces
sea foam
of the earth
carrots
grapes
but
of the ocean
truth
of the unknown
of the
unfathomable
shadow the
depths
of the sea
the abyss
only you had survived
a pitch black varnished
witness
to deepest night
only you well aimed
dark bullet
from the abyss
mangled at one tip
but constantly
reborn
at anchor in the current
winged fins
windmilling
in the swift
flight
of
the
marine
shadow
a mourning arrow
dart of the sea
olive oily fish
i saw you dead
a deceased king
of my own ocean
green
assault silver
submarine fir
seed
of seaquakes
now
only dead remains
yet
in all the market
yours
was the only
purposeful form
amid
the bewildering rout
of nature
amid the fragile greens
you were
a solitary ship
armed
among the vegetables
fin and prow black and oiled
as if you were still
the vessel of the wind
the one and only
pure
ocean
machine
unflawed navigating
the waters of death
out of lemon flowers
loosed
on the moonlight love s
lashed and insatiable
essences
sodden with fragrance
the lemon tree s yellow
emerges
the lemons
move down
from the tree s planetarium
delicate merchandise
the harbors are big with it
bazaars
for the light and the
barbarous gold
we open
the halves
of a miracle
and a clotting of acids
brims
into the starry
divisions
creation s
original juices
irreducible changeless
alive
so the freshness lives on
in a lemon
in the sweet smelling house of the rind
the proportions arcane and acerb
cutting the lemon
the knife
leaves a little cathedral
alcoves unguessed by the eye
that open acidulous glass
to the light topazes
riding the droplets
altars
aromatic facades
so while the hand
holds the cut of the lemon
half a world
on a trencher
the gold of the universe
wells
to your touch
a cup yellow
with miracles
a breast and a nipple
perfuming the earth
a flashing made fruitage
the diminutive fire of a planet
with chaste heart and pure
eyes
i celebrate you my beauty
restraining my blood
so that the line
surges and follows
your contour
and you bed yourself in my verse
as in woodland or wave spume
earth s perfume
sea s music
nakedly beautiful
whether it is your feet arching
at a primal touch
of sound or breeze
or your ears
tiny spiral shells
from the splendour of america s oceans
your breasts also
of equal fullness overflowing
with the living light
and yes
winged
your eyelids of silken corn
that disclose
or enclose
the deep twin landscapes of your eyes
the line of your back
separating you
falls away into paler regions
then surges
to the smooth hemispheres
of an apple
and goes splitting
your loveliness
into two pillars
of burnt gold pure alabaster
to be lost in the twin clusters of your feet
from which once more lifts and takes fire
the double tree of your symmetry
flower of fire open circle of candles
swollen fruit raised
over the meeting of earth and ocean
your body from what substances
agate quartz ears of wheat
did it flow was it gathered
rising like bread
in the warmth
and signalling hills
silvered
valleys of a single petal sweetnesses
of velvet depth
until the pure fine form of woman
thickened
and rested there
it is not so much light that falls
over the world
extended by your body
its suffocating snow
as brightness pouring itself out of you
as if you were
burning inside
under your skin the moon is alive
the artichoke
of delicate heart
erect
in its battle dress builds
its minimal cupola
keeps
stark
in its scallop of
scales
around it
demoniac vegetables
bristle their thicknesses
devise
tendrils and belfries
the bulb s agitations
while under the subsoil
the carrot
sleeps sound in its
rusty mustaches
runner and filaments
bleach in the vineyards
whereon rise the vines
the sedulous cabbage
arranges its petticoats
oregano
sweetens a world
and the artichoke
dulcetly there in a gardenplot
armed for a skirmish
goes proud
in its pomegranate
burnishes
till on a day
each by the other
the artichoke moves
to its dream
of a market place
in the big willow
hoppers
a battle formation
most warlike
of defilades
with men
in the market stalls
white shirts
in the soup greens
artichoke field marshals
close order conclaves
commands detonations
and voices
a crashing of crate staves
and
maria
come
down
with her hamper
to
make trial
of an artichoke
she reflects she examines
she candles them up to the light like an egg
never flinching
she bargains
she tumbles her prize
in a market bag
among shoes and a
cabbage head
a bottle
of vinegar is back
in her kitchen
the artichoke drowns in a pot
so you have it
a vegetable armed
a profession
call it an artichoke
whose end
is millennial
we taste of that
sweetness
dismembering scale after scale
we eat of a halcyon paste
it is green at the artichoke heart
now
let s look for birds
the tall iron branches
in the forest
the dense
fertility on the ground
the world
is wet
a dewdrop or raindrop
shines
a diminutive star
among the leaves
the morning time
mother earth
is cool
the air
is like a river
which shakes
the silence
it smells of rosemary
of space
and roots
overhead
a crazy song
it s a bird
how
out of its throat
smaller than a finger
can there fall the waters
of its song
luminous ease
invisible
power
torrent
of music
in the leaves
sacred conversations
clean and fresh washed
is this
day resounding
like a green dulcimer
i bury
my shoes
in the mud
jump over rivulets
a thorn
bites me and a gust
of air like a crystal
wave
splits up inside my chest
where
are the birds
maybe it was
that
rustling in the foliage
or that fleeting pellet
of brown velvet
or that displaced
perfume that
leaf that let loose cinnamon smell
was that a bird that dust
from an irritated magnolia
or that fruit
which fell with a thump
was that a flight
oh invisible little
critters
birds of the devil
with their ringing
with their useless feathers
i only want
to caress them
to see them resplendent
i don t want
to see under glass
the embalmed lightning
i want to see them living
i want to touch their gloves
of real hide
which they never forget in
the branches
and to converse with
them
sitting on my shoulders
although they may leave
me like certain statues
undeservedly whitewashed
impossible
you can t touch them
you can hear them
like a heavenly
rustle or movement
they converse
with precision
they repeat
their observations
they brag
of how much they do
they comment
on everything that exists
they learn
certain sciences
like hydrography
and by a sure science
they know
where there are harvests
of grain
things get broken
at home
like they were pushed
by an invisible deliberate smasher
it s not my hands
or yours
it wasn t the girls
with their hard fingernails
or the motion of the planet
it wasn t anything or anybody
it wasn t the wind
it wasn t the orange colored noontime
or night over the earth
it wasn t even the nose or the elbow
or the hips getting bigger
or the ankle
or the air
the plate broke the lamp fell
all the flower pots tumbled over
one by one that pot
which overflowed with scarlet
in the middle of october
it got tired from all the violets
and another empty one
rolled round and round and round
all through winter
until it was only the powder
of a flowerpot
a broken memory shining dust
and that clock
whose sound
was
the voice of our lives
the secret
thread of our weeks
which released
one by one so many hours
for honey and silence
for so many births and jobs
that clock also
fell
and its delicate blue guts
vibrated
among the broken glass
its wide heart
unsprung
life goes on grinding up
glass wearing out clothes
making fragments
breaking down
forms
and what lasts through time
is like an island on a ship in the sea
perishable
surrounded by dangerous fragility
by merciless waters and threats
let s put all our treasures together
the clocks plates cups cracked by the cold
into a sack and carry them
to the sea
and let our possessions sink
into one alarming breaker
that sounds like a river
may whatever breaks
be reconstructed by the sea
with the long labor of its tides
so many useless things
which nobody broke
but which got broken anyway
every morning you wait
clothes over a chair
to fill yourself with
my vanity my love
my hope my body
barely
risen from sleep
i relinquish the water
enter your sleeves
my legs look for
the hollows of your legs
and so embraced
by your indefatigable faithfulness
i rise to tread the grass
enter poetry
consider through the windows
the things
the men the women
the deeds and the fights
go on forming me
go on making me face things
working my hands
opening my eyes
using my mouth
and so
clothes
i too go forming you
extending your elbows
snapping your threads
and so your life expands
in the image of my life
in the wind
you billow and snap
as if you were my soul
at bad times
you cling
to my bones
vacant for the night
darkness sleep
populate with their phantoms
your wings and mine
i wonder
if one day
a bullet
from the enemy
will leave you stained with my blood
and then
you will die with me
or one day
not quite
so dramatic
but simple
you will fall ill
clothes
with me
grow old
with me with my body
and joined
we will enter
the earth
because of this
each day
i greet you
with reverence and then
you embrace me and i forget you
because we are one
and we will go on
facing the wind in the night
the streets or the fight
a single body
one day one day some day still
in the storm tossed
chilean
sea
lives the rosy conger
giant eel
of snowy flesh
and in chilean
stewpots
along the coast
was born the chowder
thick and succulent
a boon to man
you bring the conger skinned
to the kitchen
its mottled skin slips off
like a glove
leaving the
grape of the sea
exposed to the world
naked
the tender eel
glistens
prepared
to serve our appetites
now
you take
garlic
first caress
that precious
ivory
smell
its irate fragrance
then
blend the minced garlic
with onion
and tomato
until the onion
is the color of gold
meanwhile steam
our regal
ocean prawns
and when
they are
tender
when the savor is
set in a sauce
combining the liquors
of the ocean
and the clear water
released from the light of the onion
then
you add the eel
that it may be immersed in glory
that it may steep in the oils
of the pot
shrink and be saturated
now all that remains is to
drop a dollop of cream
into the concoction
a heavy rose
then slowly
deliver
the treasure to the flame
until in the chowder
are warmed
the essences of chile
and to the table
come newly wed
the savors
of land and sea
that in this dish
you may know heaven
america from a grain
of maize you grew
to crown
with spacious lands
the ocean foam
a grain of maize was your geography
from the grain
a green lance rose
was covered with gold
to grace the heights
of peru with its yellow tassels
but poet let
history rest in its shroud
praise with your lyre
the grain in its granaries
sing to the simple maize in the kitchen
first a fine beard
fluttered in the field
above the tender teeth
of the young ear
then the husks parted
and fruitfulness burst its veils
of pale papyrus
that grains of laughter
might fall upon the earth
to the stone
in your journey
you returned
not to the terrible stone
the bloody
triangle of mexican death
but to the grinding stone
sacred
stone of your kitchens
there milk and matter
strength giving nutritious
cornmeal pulp
you were worked and patted
by the wondrous hands
of dark skinned women
wherever you fall maize
whether into the
splendid pot of partridge or among
country beans you light up
the meal and lend it
your virginal flavor
oh to bite into
the steaming ear beside the sea
of distant song and deepest waltz
to boil you
as your aroma
spreads through
blue sierras
but is there
no end
to your treasure
in chalky barren lands
bordered
by the sea along
the rocky chilean coast
at times
only your radiance
reaches the empty
table of the miner
your light your cornmeal your hope
pervades america s solitudes
and to hunger
your lances
are enemy legions
within your husks
like gentle kernels
our sober provincial
children s hearts were nurtured
until life began
to shuck us from the ear
mara mori brought me
a pair of socks
which she knitted herself
with her sheepherder s hands
two socks as soft as rabbits
i slipped my feet into them
as if they were two cases
knitted with threads of twilight and goatskin
violent socks
my feet were two fish made of wool
two long sharks
sea blue shot through
by one golden thread
two immense blackbirds
two cannons
my feet were honored in this way
by these heavenly socks
they were so handsome for the first time
my feet seemed to me unacceptable
like two decrepit firemen
firemen unworthy of that woven fire
of those glowing socks
nevertheless i resisted the sharp temptation
to save them somewhere as schoolboys
keep fireflies
as learned men collect
sacred texts
i resisted the mad impulse to put them
in a golden cage and each day give them
birdseed and pieces of pink melon
like explorers in the jungle
who hand over the very rare green deer
to the spit and eat it with remorse
i stretched out my feet and pulled on
the magnificent socks and then my shoes
the moral of my ode is this
beauty is twice beauty
and what is good is doubly good
when it is a matter of two socks
made of wool in winter
sadness scarab
with seven crippled feet
spiderweb egg
scramble brained rat
bitch s skeleton
no entry here
don t come in
go away
go back
south with your umbrella
go back
north with your serpent s teeth
a poet lives here
no sadness may
cross this threshold
through these windows
comes the breath of the world
fresh red roses
flags embroidered with
the victories of the people
no
no entry
flap
your bat s wings
i will trample the feathers
that fall from your mantle
i will sweep the bits and pieces
of your carcass to
the four corners of the wind
i will wring your neck
i will stitch your eyelids shut
i will sew your shroud
sadness and bury your rodent bones
beneath the springtime of an apple tree
this salt
in the saltcellar
i once saw in the salt mines
i know
you won t
believe me
but
it sings
salt sings the skin
of the salt mines
sings
with a mouth smothered
by the earth
i shivered in those solitudes
when i heard
the voice of
the salt
in the desert
near antofagasta
the nitrous
pampa
resounds
a broken
voice
a mournful
song
in its caves
the salt moans mountain
of buried light
translucent cathedral
crystal of the sea oblivion
of the waves
and then on every table
in the world
salt
we see your piquant
powder
sprinkling
vital light
upon
our food preserver
of the ancient
holds of ships
discoverer
on
the high seas
earliest
sailor
of the unknown shifting
byways of the foam
dust of the sea in you
the tongue receives a kiss
from ocean night
taste imparts to every seasoned
dish your ocean essence
the smallest
miniature
wave from the saltcellar
reveals to us
more than domestic whiteness
in it we taste infinitude
the artichoke
with a tender heart
dressed up like a warrior
standing at attention it built
a small helmet
under its scales
it remained
unshakeable
by its side
the crazy vegetables
uncurled
their tendrills and leaf crowns
throbbing bulbs
in the sub soil
the carrot
with its red mustaches
was sleeping
the grapevine
hung out to dry its branches
through which the wine will rise
the cabbage
dedicated itself
to trying on skirts
the oregano
to perfuming the world
and the sweet
artichoke
there in the garden
dressed like a warrior
burnished
like a proud
pomegrante
and one day
side by side
in big wicker baskets
walking through the market
to realize their dream
the artichoke army
in formation
never was it so military
like on parade
the men
in their white shirts
among the vegetables
were
the marshals
of the artichokes
lines in close order
command voices
and the bang
of a falling box
but
then

comes
with her basket
she chooses
an artichoke
she s not afraid of it
she examines it she observes it
up against the light like it was an egg
she buys it
she mixes it up
in her handbag
with a pair of shoes
with a cabbage head and a
bottle
of vinegar
until
she enters the kitchen
and submerges it in a pot
thus ends
in peace
this career
of the armed vegetable
which is called an artichoke
then
scale by scale
we strip off
the delicacy
and eat
the peaceful mush
of its green heart
when i close a book
i open life
i hear
faltering cries
among harbours
copper ignots
slide down sand pits
to tocopilla
night time
among the islands
our ocean
throbs with fish
touches the feet the thighs
the chalk ribs
of my country
the whole of night
clings to its shores by dawn
it wakes up singing
as if it had excited a guitar
the ocean s surge is calling
the wind
calls me
and rodriguez calls
and jose antonio
i got a telegram
from the mine union
and the one i love
whose name i won t let out
expects me in bucalemu
no book has been able
to wrap me in paper
to fill me up
with typography
with heavenly imprints
or was ever able
to bind my eyes
i come out of books to people orchards
with the hoarse family of my song
to work the burning metals
or to eat smoked beef
by mountain firesides
i love adventurous
books
books of forest or snow
depth or sky
but hate
the spider book
in which thought
has laid poisonous wires
to trap the juvenile
and circling fly
book let me go
i won t go clothed
in volumes
i don t come out
of collected works
my poems
have not eaten poems
they devour
exciting happenings
feed on rough weather
and dig their food
out of earth and men
i m on my way
with dust in my shoes
free of mythology
send books back to their shelves
i m going down into the streets
i learned about life
from life itself
love i learned in a single kiss
and could teach no one anything
except that i have lived
with something in common among men
when fighting with them
when saying all their say in my song
from blossoms
released
by the moonlight
from an
aroma of exasperated
love
steeped in fragrance
yellowness
drifted from the lemon tree
and from its plantarium
lemons descended to the earth
tender yield
the coasts
the markets glowed
with light with
unrefined gold
we opened
two halves
of a miracle
congealed acid
trickled
from the hemispheres
of a star
the most intense liqueur
of nature
unique vivid
concentrated
born of the cool fresh
lemon
of its fragrant house
its acid secret symmetry
knives
sliced a small
cathedral
in the lemon
the concealed apse opened
revealed acid stained glass
drops
oozed topaz
altars
cool architecture
so when you hold
the hemisphere
of a cut lemon
above your plate
you spill
a universe of gold
a
yellow goblet
of miracles
a fragrant nipple
of the earth s breast
a ray of light that was made fruit
the minute fire of a planet
onion
luminous flask
your beauty formed
petal by petal
crystal scales expanded you
and in the secrecy of the dark earth
your belly grew round with dew
under the earth
the miracle
happened
and when your clumsy
green stem appeared
and your leaves were born
like swords
in the garden
the earth heaped up her power
showing your naked transparency
and as the remote sea
in lifting the breasts of aphrodite
duplicating the magnolia
so did the earth
make you
onion
clear as a planet
and destined
to shine
constant constellation
round rose of water
upon
the table
of the poor
you make us cry without hurting us
i have praised everything that exists
but to me onion you are
more beautiful than a bird
of dazzling feathers
heavenly globe platinum goblet
unmoving dance
of the snowy anemone
and the fragrance of the earth lives
in your crystalline nature
the street
filled with tomatoes
midday
summer
light is
halved
like
a
tomato
its juice
runs
through the streets
in december
unabated
the tomato
invades
the kitchen
it enters at lunchtime
takes
its ease
on countertops
among glasses
butter dishes
blue saltcellars
it sheds
its own light
benign majesty
unfortunately we must
murder it
the knife
sinks
into living flesh
red
viscera
a cool
sun
profound
inexhaustible
populates the salads
of chile
happily it is wed
to the clear onion
and to celebrate the union
we
pour
oil
essential
child of the olive
onto its halved hemispheres
pepper
adds
its fragrance
salt its magnetism
it is the wedding
of the day
parsley
hoists
its flag
potatoes
bubble vigorously
the aroma
of the roast
knocks
at the door
it s time
come on
and on
the table at the midpoint
of summer
the tomato
star of earth recurrent
and fertile
star
displays
its convolutions
its canals
its remarkable amplitude
and abundance
no pit
no husk
no leaves or thorns
the tomato offers
its gift
of fiery color
and cool completeness
day colored wine
night colored wine
wine with purple feet
or wine with topaz blood
wine
starry child
of earth
wine smooth
as a golden sword
soft
as lascivious velvet
wine spiral seashelled
and full of wonder
amorous
marine
never has one goblet contained you
one song one man
you are choral gregarious
at the least you must be shared
at times
you feed on mortal
memories
your wave carries us
from tomb to tomb
stonecutter of icy sepulchers
and we weep
transitory tears
your
glorious
spring dress
is different
blood rises through the shoots
wind incites the day
nothing is left
of your immutable soul
wine
stirs the spring happiness
bursts through the earth like a plant
walls crumble
and rocky cliffs
chasms close
as song is born
a jug of wine and thou beside me
in the wilderness
sang the ancient poet
let the wine pitcher
add to the kiss of love its own
my darling suddenly
the line of your hip
becomes the brimming curve
of the wine goblet
your breast is the grape cluster
your nipples are the grapes
the gleam of spirits lights your hair
and your navel is a chaste seal
stamped on the vessel of your belly
your love an inexhaustible
cascade of wine
light that illuminates my senses
the earthly splendor of life
but you are more than love
the fiery kiss
the heat of fire
more than the wine of life
you are
the community of man
translucency
chorus of discipline
abundance of flowers
i like on the table
when we re speaking
the light of a bottle
of intelligent wine
drink it
and remember in every
drop of gold
in every topaz glass
in every purple ladle
that autumn labored
to fill the vessel with wine
and in the ritual of his office
let the simple man remember
to think of the soil and of his duty
to propagate the canticle of the wine
perhaps not to be is to be without your being
without your going that cuts noon light
like a blue flower without your passing
later through fog and stones
without the torch you lift in your hand
that others may not see as golden
that perhaps no one believed blossomed
the glowing origin of the rose
without in the end your being your coming
suddenly inspiringly to know my life
blaze of the rose tree wheat of the breeze
and it follows that i am because you are
it follows from you are that i am and we
and because of love you will i will
we will come to be
to whoever is not listening to the sea
this friday morning to whoever is cooped up
in house or office factory or woman
or street or mine or harsh prison cell
to him i come and without speaking or looking
i arrive and open the door of his prison
and a vibration starts up vague and insistent
a great fragment of thunder sets in motion
the rumble of the planet and the foam
the raucous rivers of the ocean flood
the star vibrates swiftly in its corona
and the sea is beating dying and continuing
so drawn on by my destiny
i ceaselessly must listen to and keep
the sea s lamenting in my awareness
i must feel the crash of the hard water
and gather it up in a perpetual cup
so that wherever those in prison may be
wherever they suffer the autumn s castigation
i may be there with an errant wave
i may move passing through windows
and hearing me eyes will glance upward
saying how can i reach the sea
and i shall broadcast saying nothing
the starry echoes of the wave
a breaking up of foam and quicksand
a rustling of salt withdrawing
the grey cry of the sea birds on the coast
so through me freedom and the sea
will make their answer to the shuttered heart
and it was at that age poetry arrived
in search of me i don t know i don t know where
it came from from winter or a river
i don t know how or when
no they were not voices they were not
words nor silence
but from a street i was summoned
from the branches of night
abruptly from the others
among violent fires
or returning alone
there i was without a face
and it touched me
i did not know what to say my mouth
had no way
with names
my eyes were blind
and something started in my soul
fever or forgotten wings
and i made my own way
deciphering
that fire
and i wrote the first faint line
faint without substance pure
nonsense
pure wisdom
of someone who knows nothing
and suddenly i saw
the heavens
unfastened
and open
planets
palpitating plantations
shadow perforated
riddled
with arrows fire and flowers
the winding night the universe
and i infinitesimal being
drunk with the great starry
void
likeness image of
mystery
felt myself a pure part
of the abyss
i wheeled with the stars
my heart broke loose on the wind
what it takes on this planet
to make love to each other in peace
everyone pries under your sheets
everyone interferes with your loving
they say terrible things about a man and a woman
who after much milling about
all sorts of compunctions
do something unique
they both lie with each other in one bed
i ask myself whether frogs are so furtive
or sneeze as they please
whether they whisper to each other in swamps about illegitimate frogs
or the joys of amphibious living
i ask myself if birds single out enemy birds
or bulls gossip with bullocks before they go out in public with cows
even the roads have eyes and the parks their police
hotels spy on their guests
windows name names
canons and squadrons debark on missions to liquidate love
all those ears and those jaws working incessantly
till a man and his girl
have to raise their climax
full tilt
on a bicycle
your whole body has
a fullness or a gentleness destined for me
when i move my hand up
i find in each place a dove
that was seeking me as
if they had love made you of clay
for my own potter s hands
your knees your breasts
your waist
are missing parts of me like the hollow
of a thirsty earth
from which they broke off
a form
and together
we are complete like a single river
like a single grain of sand
so that you will hear me
my words
sometimes grow thin
as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches
necklace drunken bell
for your hands smooth as grapes
and i watch my words from a long way off
they are more yours than mine
they climb on my old suffering like ivy
it climbs the same way on damp walls
you are to blame for this cruel sport
they are fleeing from my dark lair
you fill everything you fill everything
before you they peopled the solitude that you occupy
and they are more used to my sadness than you are
now i want them to say what i want to say to you
to make you hear as i want you to hear me
the wind of anguish still hauls on them as usual
sometimes hurricanes of dreams still knock them over
you listen to other voices in my painful voice
lament of old mouths blood of old supplications
love me companion don t forsake me follow me
follow me companion on this wave of anguish
but my words become stained with your love
you occupy everything you occupy everything
i am making them into an endless necklace
for your white hands smooth as grapes
it was the twilight of the iguana
from a rainbowing battlement
a tongue like a javelin
lunging in verdure
an ant heap treading the jungle
monastic on musical feet
the guanaco oxygen fine
in the high places swarthed with distances
cobbling his feet into gold
the llama of scrupulous eye
the widens his gaze on the dews
of a delicate world
a monkey is weaving
a thread of insatiable lusts
on the margins of morning
he topples a pollen fall
startles the violet flight
of the butterfly wings on the muzo
it was the night of the alligator
snouts moving out of the slime
in original darkness the pullulations
a clatter of armour opaque
in the sleep of the bog
turning back to the chalk of the sources
the jaguar touches the leaves
with his phosphorous absence
the puma speeds to his covert
in the blaze of his hungers
his eyeballs a jungle of alcohol
burn in his head
neither the heart cut by a piece of glass
in a wasteland of thorns
nor the atrocious waters seen in the corners
of certain houses waters like eyelids and eyes
can capture your waist in my hands
when my heart lifts its oaks
towards your unbreakable thread of snow
nocturnal sugar spirit
of the crowns
ransomed
human blood your kisses
send into exile
and a stroke of water with remnants of the sea
neats on the silences that wait for you
surrounding the worn chairs wearing out doors
nights with bright spindles
divided material nothing
but voice nothing but
naked every day
over your breasts of motionless current
over your legs of firmness and water
over the permanence and the pride
of your naked hair
i want to be my love now that the tears are
thrown
into the raucous baskets where they accumulate
i want to be my love alone with a syllable
of mangled silver alone with a tip
of your breast of snow
there where the waves shatter on the restless rocks
the clear light bursts and enacts its rose
and the sea circle shrinks to a cluster of buds
to one drop of blue salt falling
o bright magnolia bursting in the foam
magnetic transient whose death blooms
and vanishes being nothingness forever
broken salt dazzling lurch of the sea
you i love together we ratify the silence
while the sea destroys its perpetual statues
collapses its towers of wild speed and whiteness
because in the weavings of those invisible fabrics
galloping water incessant sand
we make the only permanent tenderness
maybe you ll remember that razor faced man
who slipped out from the dark like a blade
and before we realized knew what was there
he saw the smoke and concluded fire
the pallid woman with black hair
rose like a fish from the abyss
and the two of them built up a contraption
armed to the teeth against love
man and woman they felled mountains and gardens
then went down to the river they scaled the walls
they hoisted their atrocious artillery up the hill
then love knew it was called love
and when i lifted my eyes to your name
suddenly your heart showed me my way
already you are mine rest with your dream inside my dream
love grief labour must sleep now
night revolves on invisible wheels
and joined to me you are pure as sleeping amber
no one else will sleep with my dream love
you will go we will go joined by the waters of time
no other one will travel the shadows with me
only you eternal nature eternal sun eternal moon
already your hands have opened their delicate fists
and let fall without direction their gentle signs
you eyes enclosing themselves like two grey wings
while i follow the waters you bring that take me onwards
night earth winds weave their fate and already
not only am i not without you i alone am your dream
if your eyes were not the color of the moon
of a day full here interrupted by the baby waking continued about
hours later
of a day full of clay and work and fire
if even held in you did not move in agile grace like the air
if you were not an amber week
not the yellow moment
when autumn climbs up through the vines
if you were not that bread the fragrant moon
kneads sprinkling its flour across the sky
oh my dearest i could not love you so
but when i hold you i hold everything that is
sand time the tree of the rain
everything is alive so that i can be alive
without moving i can see it all
in your life i see everything that lives
who ever desired each other as we do let us look
for the ancient ashes of hearts that burned
and let our kisses touch there one by one
till the flower disembodied rises again
let us love that desire that consumed its own fruit
and went down aspect and power into the earth
we are its continuing light
its indestructible fragile seed
i crave your mouth your voice your hair
silent and starving i prowl through the streets
bread does not nourish me dawn disrupts me all day
i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps
i hunger for your sleek laugh
your hands the color of a savage harvest
hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails
i want to eat your skin like a whole almond
i want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body
the sovereign nose of your arrogant face
i want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes
and i pace around hungry sniffing the twilight
hunting for you for your hot heart
like a puma in the barrens of quitratue
the light that rises from your feet to your hair
the strength enfolding your delicate form
are not mother of pearl not chilly silver
you are made of bread a bread the fire adores
the grain grew high in its harvest of you
in good time the flour swelled
as the dough rose doubling your breasts
my love was the coal waiting ready in the earth
oh bread your forehead your legs your mouth
bread i devour born with the morning light
my love beacon flag of the bakeries
fire taugh you a lesson of the blood
you learned your holiness from flour
from bread your language and aroma
i hunt for a sign of you in all the others
in the rapid undulant river of women
braids shyly sinking eyes
light step that slices sailing through the foam
suddenly i think i can make out your nails
oblong quick nieces of a cherry
then it s your hair that passes by and i think
i see your image a bonfire burning in the water
i searched but no one else had your rhythms
your light the shady day you brought from the forest
nobody had your tiny ears
you are whole exact and everything you are is one
and so i go along with you i float along loving
a wide mississippi toward a feminine sea
i do not love you as if you were salt rose or topaz
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off
i love you as certain dark things are to be loved
in secret between the shadow and the soul
i love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance
risen from the earth lives darkly in my body
i love you without knowing how or when or from where
i love you straightforwardly without complexities or pride
so i love you because i know no other way
than this where i does not exist nor you
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand
so close that your eyes close as i fall asleep
naked you are simple as one of your hands
smooth earthy small transparent round
you have moonlines applepathways
naked you are slender as a naked grain of wheat
naked you are blue as the night in cuba
you have vines and stars in your hair
naked you are spacious and yellow
as summer in a golden church
naked you are tiny as one of your nails
curved subtle rosy till the day is born
and you withdraw to the underground world
as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores
your clear light dims gets dressed drops its leaves
and becomes a naked hand again
you are the daughter of the sea oregano s first cousin
swimmer your body is pure as the water
cook your blood is quick as the soil
everything you do is full of flowers rich with the earth
your eyes go out toward the water and the waves rise
your hands go out to the earth and the seeds swell
you know the deep essence of water and the earth
conjoined in you like a formula for clay
naiad cut your body into turquoise pieces
they will bloom resurrected in the kitchen
this is how you become everything that lives
and so at last you sleep in the circle of my arms
that push back the shadows so that you can rest
vegetables seaweed herbs the foam of your dreams
translated by stephen tapscott
tell me is the rose naked
or is that her only dress
why do trees conceal
the splendor of their roots
who hears the regrets
of the thieving automobile
is there anything in the world sadder
than a train standing in the rain
if suddenly you do not exist
if suddenly you are not living
i shall go on living
i do not dare
i do not dare to write it
if you die
i shall go on living
because where a man has no voice
there my voice
where blacks are beaten
i can not be dead
when my brothers go to jail
i shall go with them
when victory
not my victory
but the great victory
arrives
even though i am mute i must speak
i shall see it come even though i am blind
no forgive me
if you are not living
ifd you beloved my love
if you
have died
an odor has remained among the sugarcane
a mixture of blood and body a penetrating
petal that brings nausea
between the coconut palms the graves are full
of ruined bones of speechless death rattles
the delicate dictator is talking
with top hats gold braid and collars
the tiny palace gleams like a watch
and the rapid laughs with gloves on
cross the corridors at times
and join the dead voices
and the blue mouths freshly buried
the weeping cannot be seen like a plant
whose seeds fall endlessly on the earth
whose large blind leaves grow even without light
hatred has grown scale on scale
blow on blow in the ghastly water of the swamp
with a snout full of ooze and silence
this day today was a brimming glass
this day today was an immense wave
this day was all the earth
this day the storm driven ocean
lifted us up in a kiss
so exalted we trembled
at the lightning flash
and bound as one fell
and drowned without being unbound
this day our bodies grew
stretched out to earth s limits
orbited there melded there
to one globe of wax or a meteor s flame
a strange door opened between us
and someone with no face as yet
waited for us there
they all ask me to jump
to invigorate and to play soccer
to run to swim and to fly
very well
they all advise me rest
they all send me to the doctor
looking at me a certain way
what happens
they all advise me to travel
to come and to leave to stay
to die and not to die
it does not matter
they all see the difficulties
of my surprised bowels
by awful x rayed portraits
i do not agree
they all sting my poetry
with relentless forks
seeking without doubt a fly
i am afraid
i am afraid of everyone
of the cold water of the death
i am like all the mortals
unavoidable
and for that in these short days
i am not going to pay attention to them
i am going to open myself up and shut myself in
with my more perfidious enemy
my eyes went away from me
following a dark girl who went by
she was made of black motherofpearl
made of darkpurple grapes
and she lashed my blood
with her tail of fire
after them all i go
a pale blonde went by
like a golden plant
swaying her gifts
and my mouth went
like a wave
discharging on her breast
lightningbolts of blood
after them all i go
but to you without my moving
without seeing you distant you
go my blood and my kisses
my dark one and my fair one
my broad one and my slender one
my ugly one my beauty
made of all the gold
and of all the silver
made of all the wheat
and of all the earth
made of all the water
of sea waves
made for my arms
made for my kisses
made for my soul
writing
these
odes
in this
year nineteen
hundred and
fifty five
readying and tuning
my demanding murmuring lyre
i know who i am
and where my song is going
i understand
that the shopper for myths
and mysteries
may enter
my wood
and adobe
house of odes
may despise
the utensils
the portraits
of father and mother and country
on the walls
the simplicity
of the bread
and the saltcellar but
that s how it is in my house of odes
i deposed the dark monarchy
the useless flowing hair of dreams
i trod on the tail
of the cerebral reptile
and set things
water and fire
in harmony with man and earth
i want everything
to have
a handle
i want everything to be
a cup or a tool
i want people to enter a hardware
store through the door of my odes
i work at
cutting
newly hewn boards
storing casks
of honey
arranging
horseshoes harness
forks
i want everyone to enter here
let them ask questions
ask for anything they want
i am from the south a chilean
a sailor
returned
from the seas
i did not stay in the islands
a king
i did not stay ensconced
in the land of dreams
i returned to labor simply
beside others
for everyone
so that everyone
may live here
i build my house
with transparent
odes
from your hips down to your feet
i want to make a long journey
i am smaller than an insect
over these hills i pass
hills the colour of oats
crossed with faint tracks
that only i know
scorched centimetres
pale perspectives
now here is a mountain
i shall never leave this
what a giant growth of moss
and a crater a rose
of moist fire
coming down your legs
i trace a spiral
or sleep on the way
and arrive at your knees
round hardness
like the hard peaks
of a bright continent
sliding down to your feet
i reach the eight slits
of your pointed slow
peninsular toes
and from them i fall down
to the white emptiness
of the sheet seeking blindly
and hungrily the form
of your fiery crucible
the light wraps you in its mortal flame
abstracted pale mourner standing that way
against the old propellers of the twighlight
that revolves around you
speechless my friend
alone in the loneliness of this hour of the dead
and filled with the lives of fire
pure heir of the ruined day
a bough of fruit falls from the sun on your dark garment
the great roots of night
grow suddenly from your soul
and the things that hide in you come out again
so that a blue and palled people
your newly born takes nourishment
oh magnificent and fecund and magnetic slave
of the circle that moves in turn through black and gold
rise lead and possess a creation
so rich in life that its flowers perish
and it is full of sadness
i m ram n gonz lez barbagelata from anywhere
from cucuy from paran from rio turbio from oruro
from maracaibo from parral from ovalle from loconmilla
i m the poor devil from the poor third world
i m the third class passenger installed good god
in the lavish whiteness of snow covered mountains
concealed among orchids of subtle idiosyncrasy
i ve arrived at this famous year and what do i get
with what do i scratch myself what do i have to do with
the three glorious zeros that flaunt themselves
over my very own zero my own non existence
pity that brave heart awaiting its call
or the man enfolded by warmer love
nothing s left today except my flimsy skeleton
my eyes unhinged confronting the era s beginning
the era s beginning are these ruined shacks
these poor schools these people still in rags and tatters
this cloddish insecurity of my poor families
is all this the day the century s beginning the golden door
well enough said i at least discreet
as in office patched and pensive
i proclaim the redundancy of the inaugural
i ve arrived here with all my baggage
bad luck and worse jobs
misery always waiting with open arms
the mobilization of people piled up on top of each other
and the manifold geography of hunger
ancient night and the unruly salt
beat at the walls of my house
the shadow is all one the sky
throbs now along with the ocean
and sky and shadow erupt
in the crash of their vast conflict
all night long they struggle
nobody knows the name
of the harsh light that keeps slowly opening
like a languid fruit
so on the coast comes to light
out of seething shadow the harsh dawn
gnawed at by the moving salt
swept clean by the mass of night
bloodstained in its sea washed crater
to the solemn sea the old women come
with their shawls knotted around their necks
with their fragile feet cracking
they sit down alone on the shore
without moving their eyes or their hands
without changing the clouds or the silence
the obscene sea breaks and claws
rushes downhill trumpeting
shakes its bull s beard
the gentle old ladies seated
as if in a transparent boat
they look at the terrorist waves
where will they go and where have they been
they come from every corner
they come from our own lives
now they have the ocean
the cold and burning emptiness
the solitude full of flames
they come from all the pasts
from houses which were fragrant
from burnt up evenings
they look or don t look at the sea
with their walking sticks they draw signs in the sand
and the sea erases their calligraphy
the old women get up and go away
with their fragile bird feet
while the waves flood in
traveling naked in the wind
i recall that man and not two centuries
have passed since i saw him
he went neither by horse nor by carriage
purely on foot
he outstripped
distances
and carried no sword or armour
only nets on his shoulder
axe or hammer or spade
never fighting the rest of his species
his exploits were with water and earth
with wheat so that it turned into bread
with giant trees to render them wood
with walls to open up doors
with sand to construct the walls
and with ocean for it to bear
i knew him and he is still not cancelled in me
the carriages fell to pieces
war destroyed doors and walls
the city was a handful of ashes
all the clothes turned to dust
and he remains to me
he survives in the sand
when everything before
seemed imperishable but him
in the going and coming of families
at times he was my father or kinsman
or perhaps it was scarcely him or not
the one who did not return to his house
because water or earth swallowed him up
or a tree or an engine killed him
or he was the saddened carpenter
who went behind the coffin without tears
someone in the end who had no name
except those that metal or timber have
and on whom others gazed from on high
without seeing the ant
for the anthill
and so that when his feet did not stir
because the poor exhausted one had died
they never saw what they had not seen
already there were other feet where he d been
the other feet were still his
and the other hands
the man remained
when it seemed that now he was done for
he was the same once more
there he was digging again at the earth
cutting cloth minus a shirt
there he was and was not like before
he had gone down and was once more
and since he never owned graveyards
or tombs nor was his name carved
on the stone he sweated to quarry
no one knew he had come
and no one knew when he died
so that only when the poor man could
he returned to life once more without it being noted
he was the man no doubt of it without heritage
without cattle without a flag
and he was not distinguished from others
the others who were him
from the heights he was grey like the subsoil
tanned like the leather
he was yellow reaping the wheat
he was black down in the mine
he was the colour of stone on the fortress
in the fishing boat the colour of tuna
and the colour of horses in the meadow
how could anyone distinguish him
if he was inseparable elemental
earth coal or sea vested in man
where he lived whatever
a man touched grew
the hostile stones
quarried
by his hands
took on order
and one by one formed
the right clarity of a building
he made bread with his hands
moved the engines
the distances peopled themselves with towns
other men grew
bees arrived
and by man s creating and breeding
spring walked the market squares
between bakeries and doves
the maker of loaves was forgotten
he who quarried and journeyed beating down
and opening furrows transporting sand
when everything existed he no longer existed
he gave his existence that s all
he went elsewhere to labour and at last
he was dead rolling
like a stone in the river
death carried him downstream
i who knew him saw him descend
till he was no longer except what he left
roads he could scarcely know
houses he never ever would live in
i turn to see him and i await him
i see him in his grave and resurrected
i distinguish him among all
who are his equals
and it seems to me it cannot be
that like this we go nowhere
that to survive like this holds no glory
i believe that this man
must be enthroned rightly shod and crowned
i believe that those who made such things
must be the masters of all these things
and that those who made bread should eat
and those in the mines must have light
enough now of grey men enslaved
enough of the pale missing ones
not another man passes except as a king
not a single woman without her crown
golden gauntlets for every hand
fruits of the sun for all the unknowns
i knew that man and when i could
when he still had eyes in his head
when he still had a voice in his mouth
i searched for him among tombs and i said
grasping his arm that was not yet dust
all will be gone you will live on
you ignite life
you made what is yours
so let no one trouble themselves when
i seem to be alone and am not alone
i am with no one and speak for them all
some listen to me without knowing
but those i sing those who do know
go on being born and will fill up the earth
oh yes i knew him i spent years with him
with his golden and stony substance
he was a man who was tired
in paraguay he left his father and mother
his sons his nephews
his latest in laws
his house his chickens
and some half opened books
they called him to the door
when he opened it the police took him
and they beat him up so much
that he spat blood in france in denmark
in spain in italy moving about
and so he died and i stopped seeing his face
stopped hearing his profound silence
then once on a night of storms
with snow spreading
a smooth cloak on the mountains
on horseback there far off
i looked and there was my friend
his face was formed in stone
his profile defied the wild weather
in his nose the wind was muffling
the moaning of the persecuted
there the exile came to ground
changed into stone he lives in his own country
i have named you queen
there are taller than you taller
there are purer than you purer
there are lovelier than you lovelier
but you are the queen
when you go through the streets
no one recognizes you
no one sees your crystal crown no one looks
at the carpet of red gold
that you tread as you pass
the nonexistent carpet
and when you appear
all the rivers sound
in my body bells
shake the sky
and a hymn fills the world
only you and i
only you and i my love
listen to me
la reina
yo te he nombrado reina
hay m s altas que t m s altas
hay m s puras que t m s puras
hay m s bellas que t hay m s bellas
pero t eres la reina
cuando vas por las calles
nadie te reconoce
nadie ve tu corona de cristal nadie mira
la alfombra de oro rojo
que pisas donde pasas
la alfombra que no existe
y cuando asomas
suenan todos los r os
en mi cuerpo sacuden
el cielo las campanas
y un himno llena el mundo
s lo t y yo
s lo t y yo amor m o
lo escuchamos
love a question
has destroyed you
i have come back to you
from thorny uncertainty
i want you straight as
the sword or the road
but you insist
on keeping a nook
of shadow that i do not want
my love
understand me
i love all of you
from eyes to feet to toenails
inside
all the brightness which you kept
it is i my love
who knocks at your door
it is not the ghost it is not
the one who once stopped
at your window
i knock down the door
i enter your life
i come to live in your soul
you cannot cope with me
you must open door to door
you must obey me
you must open your eyes
so that i may search in them
you must see how i walk
with heavy steps
along all the roads
that blind were waiting for me
do not fear
i am yours
but
i am not the passenger or the beggar
i am your master
the one you were waiting for
and now i enter
your life
no more to leave it
love love love
but to stay
the tree is here still in pure stone
in deep evidence in solid beauty
layered through a hundred million years
agate cornelian gemstone
transmuted the timber and sap
until damp corruptions
fissured the giant s trunk
fusing a parallel being
the living leaves
unmade themselves
and when the pillar was overthrown
fire in the forest blaze of the dust cloud
celestial ashes mantled it round
until time and the lava created
this gift of translucent stone
when the trumpet sounded it was
all prepared on the earth
the jehovah parcelled out the earth
to coca cola inc anaconda
ford motors and other entities
the fruit company inc
reserved for itself the most succulent
the central coast of my own land
the delicate waist of america
it rechristened its territories
as the banana republics
and over the sleeping dead
over the restless heroes
who brought about the greatness the liberty and the flags
it established the comic opera
abolished the independencies
presented crowns of caesar
unsheathed envy attracted
the dictatorship of the flies
trujillo flies tacho flies
carias flies martines flies
ubico flies damp flies
of modest blood and marmalade
drunken flies who zoom
over the ordinary graves
circus flies wise flies
well trained in tyranny
among the blood thirsty flies
the fruit company lands its ships
taking off the coffee and the fruit
the treasure of our submerged
territories flow as though
on plates into the ships
meanwhile indians are falling
into the sugared chasms
of the harbours wrapped
for burials in the mist of the dawn
a body rolls a thing
that has no name a fallen cipher
a cluster of the dead fruit
thrown down on the dump
the weary one orphan
of the masses the self
the crushed one the one made of concrete
the one without a country in crowded restaurants
he who wanted to go far away always farther away
didn t know what to do there whether he wanted
or didn t want to leave or remain on the island
the hesitant one the hybrid entangled in himself
had no place here the straight angled stone
the infinite look of the granite prism
the circular solitude all banished him
he went somewhere else with his sorrows
he returned to the agony of his native land
to his indecisions of winter and summer
lost in the forest i broke off a dark twig
and lifted its whisper to my thirsty lips
maybe it was the voice of the rain crying
a cracked bell or a torn heart
something from far off it seemed
deep and secret to me hidden by the earth
a shout muffled by huge autumns
by the moist half open darkness of the leaves
wakening from the dreaming forest there the hazel sprig
sang under my tongue its drifting fragrance
climbed up through my conscious mind
as if suddenly the roots i had left behind
cried out to me the land i had lost with my childhood
and i stopped wounded by the wandering scent
ocean if you were to give a measure a ferment a fruit
of your gifts and destructions into my hand
i would choose your far off repose your contour of steel
your vigilant spaces of air and darkness
and the power of your white tongue
that shatters and overthrows columns
breaking them down to your proper purity
not the final breaker heavy with brine
that thunders onshore and creates
the silence of sand that encircles the world
but the inner spaces of force
the naked power of the waters
the immoveable solitude brimming with lives
it is time perhaps or the vessel filled
with all motion pure oneness
that death cannot touch the visceral green
of consuming totality
only a salt kiss remains of the drowned arm
that lifts a spray a humid scent
of the damp flower is left
from the bodies of men your energies
form in a trickle that is not spent
form in retreat into silence
the falling wave
arch of identity shattering feathers
is only spume when it clears
and returns to its source unconsumed
your whole force heads for its origin
the husks that your load threshes
are only the crushed plundered deliveries
that your act of abundance expelled
all those that take life from your branches
your form extends beyond breakers
vibrant and rhythmic like the chest cloaking
a single being and its breathings
that lift into the content of light
plains raised above waves
forming the naked surface of earth
you fill your true self with your substance
you overflow curve with silence
the vessel trembles with your salt and sweetness
the universal cavern of waters
and nothing is lost from you as it is
from the desolate crater or the bay of a hill
those empty heights signs scars
guarding the wounded air
your petals throbbing against the earth
trembling your submarine harvests
your menace thickening the smooth swell
with pulsations and swarming of schools
and only the thread of the net raises
the dead lightning of fish scale
one wounded millimetre in the space
of your crystal completeness
tie your heart at night to mine love
and both will defeat the darkness
like twin drums beating in the forest
against the heavy wall of wet leaves
night crossing black coal of dream
that cuts the thread of earthly orbs
with the punctuality of a headlong train
that pulls cold stone and shadow endlessly
love because of it tie me to a purer movement
to the grip on life that beats in your breast
with the wings of a submerged swan
so that our dream might reply
to the sky s questioning stars
with one key one door closed to shadow
tonight i can write the saddest lines
write for example the night is starry
and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance
the night wind revolves in the sky and sings
tonight i can write the saddest lines
i loved her and sometimes she loved me too
through nights like this one i held her in my arms
i kissed her again and again under the endless sky
she loved me sometimes i loved her too
how could one not have loved her great still eyes
tonight i can write the saddest lines
to think that i do not have her to feel that i have lost her
to hear the immense night still more immense without her
and the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture
what does it matter that my love could not keep her
the night is starry and she is not with me
this is all in the distance someone is singing in the distance
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her
my sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer
my heart looks for her and she is not with me
the same night whitening the same trees
we of that time are no longer the same
i no longer love her that s certain but how i loved her
my voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing
another s she will be another s as she was before my kisses
her voice her bright body her infinite eyes
i no longer love her that s certain but maybe i love her
love is so short forgetting is so long
because through nights like this one i held her in my arms
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her
though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that i write for her
translated by w s merwin
o tower of light sad beauty
that magnified necklaces and statues in the sea
calcareous eye insignia of the vast waters cry
of the mourning petrel tooth of the sea wife
of the oceanian wind o separate rose
from the long stem of the trampled bush
that the depths converted into archipelago
o natural star green diadem
alone in your lonesome dynasty
still unattainable elusive desolate
like one drop like one grape like the sea
three triangles of birds crossed
over the enormous ocean which extended
in winter like a green beast
everything just lay there the silence
the unfolding gray the heavy light
of space some land now and then
over everything there was passing
a flight
and another flight
of dark birds winter bodies
trembling triangles
whose wings
frantically flapping hardly
can carry the gray cold the desolate days
from one place to another
along the coast of chile
i am here while from one sky to another
the trembling of the migratory birds
leaves me sunk inside myself inside my own matter
like an everlasting well
dug by an immovable spiral
now they have disappeared
black feathers of the sea
iron birds
from steep slopes and rock piles
now at noon
i am in front of emptiness it s a winter
space stretched out
and the sea has put
over its blue face
a bitter mask
it so happens i am sick of being a man
and it happens that i walk into tailorshops and movie
houses
dried up waterproof like a swan made of felt
steering my way in a water of wombs and ashes
the smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse
sobs
the only thing i want is to lie still like stones or wool
the only thing i want is to see no more stores no gardens
no more goods no spectacles no elevators
it so happens that i am sick of my feet and my nails
and my hair and my shadow
it so happens i am sick of being a man
still it would be marvelous
to terrify a law clerk with a cut lily
or kill a nun with a blow on the ear
it would be great
to go through the streets with a green knife
letting out yells until i died of the cold
i don t want to go on being a root in the dark
insecure stretched out shivering with sleep
going on down into the moist guts of the earth
taking in and thinking eating every day
i don t want so much misery
i don t want to go on as a root and a tomb
alone under the ground a warehouse with corpses
half frozen dying of grief
that s why monday when it sees me coming
with my convict face blazes up like gasoline
and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel
and leaves tracks full of warm blood leading toward the
night
and it pushes me into certain corners into some moist
houses
into hospitals where the bones fly out the window
into shoeshops that smell like vinegar
and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin
there are sulphur colored birds and hideous intestines
hanging over the doors of houses that i hate
and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot
there are mirrors
that ought to have wept from shame and terror
there are umbrellas everywhere and venoms and umbilical
cords
i stroll along serenely with my eyes my shoes
my rage forgetting everything
i walk by going through office buildings and orthopedic
shops
and courtyards with washing hanging from the line
underwear towels and shirts from which slow
dirty tears are falling
share this poem
i touch hatred like a covered breast
i without stopping go from garment to garment
sleeping at a distance
i am not i m of no use i do not know
anyone i have no weapons of ocean or wood
i do not live in this house
my mouth is full of night and water
the abiding moon determines
what i do not have
what i have is in the midst of the waves
a ray of water a day for myself
an iron depth
there is no cross tide there is no shield no costume
there is no special solution too deep to be sounded
no vicious eyelid
i live suddenly and other times i follow
i touch a face suddenly and it murders me
i have no time
do not look for me when drawing
the usual wild thread or the
bleeding net
do not call me that is my occupation
do not ask my name or my condition
leave me in the middle of my own moon
in my wounded ground
everything on the earth bristled the bramble
pricked and the green thread
nibbled away the petal fell falling
until the only flower was the falling itself
water is another matter
has no direction but its own bright grace
runs through all imaginable colors
takes limpid lessons
from stone
and in those functionings plays out
the unrealized ambitions of the foam
of the many men whom i am whom we are
i cannot settle on a single one
they are lost to me under the cover of clothing
they have departed for another city
when everything seems to be set
to show me off as a man of intelligence
the fool i keep concealed on my person
takes over my talk and occupies my mouth
on other occasions i am dozing in the midst
of people of some distinction
and when i summon my courageous self
a coward completely unknown to me
swaddles my poor skeleton
in a thousand tiny reservations
when a stately home bursts into flames
instead of the fireman i summon
an arsonist bursts on the scene
and he is i there is nothing i can do
what must i do to distinguish myself
how can i put myself together
all the books i read
lionize dazzling hero figures
brimming with self assurance
i die with envy of them
and in films where bullets fly on the wind
i am left in envy of the cowboys
left admiring even the horses
but when i call upon my dashing being
out comes the same old lazy self
and so i never know just who i am
nor how many i am nor who we will be being
i would like to be able to touch a bell
and call up my real self the truly me
because if i really need my proper self
i must not allow myself to disappear
while i am writing i am far away
and when i come back i have already left
i should like to see if the same thing happens
to other people as it does to me
to see if as many people are as i am
and if they seem the same way to themselves
when this problem has been thoroughly explored
i am going to school myself so well in things
that when i try to explain my problems
i shall speak not of self but of geography
spain was a taut dry drum head
daily beating a dull thud
flatlands and eagle s nest
silence lashed by the storm
how much to the point of weeping in my soul
i love your hard soil your poor bread
your poor people how much in the deep place
of my being there is still the lost flower
of your wrinkled villages motionless in time
and your metallic meadows
stretched out in the moonlight through the ages
now devoured by a false god
all your confinement your animal isolation
while you are still conscious
surrounded by the abstract stones of silence
your rough wine your smooth wine
your violent and dangerous vineyards
solar stone pure among the regions
of the world spain streaked
with blood and metal blue and victorious
proletarian spain made of petals and bullets
unique alive asleep resounding
i do not love you as if you were salt rose or topaz
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off
i love you as certain dark things are to be loved
in secret between the shadow and the soul
i love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance
risen from the earth lives darkly in my body
i love you without knowing how or when or from where
i love you straightforwardly without complexities or pride
so i love you because i know no other way
than this where i does not exist nor you
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand
so close that your eyes close as i fall asleep
thinking tangling shadows in the deep solitude
you are far away too oh farther than anyone
thinking freeing birds dissolving images
burying lamps
belfry of fogs how far away up there
stifling laments milling shadowy hopes
taciturn miller
night falls on you face downward far from the city
your presence is foreign as strange to me as a thing
i think i explore great tracts of my life before you
my life before anyone my harsh life
the shout facing the sea among the rocks
running free mad in the sea spray
the sad rage the shout the solitude of the sea
headlong violent stretched towards the sky
you woman what were you there what ray what vane
of that immense fan you were as far as you are now
fire in the forest burn in blue crosses
burn burn flame up sparkle in trees of light
it collapses crackling fire fire
and my soul dances seared with curls of fire
who calls what silence peopled with echoes
hour of nostalgia hour of happiness hour of solitude
hour that is mine from among them all
megaphone in which the wind passes singing
such a passion of weeping tied to my body
shaking of all the roots
attack of all the waves
my soul wandered happy sad unending
thinking burying lamps in the deep solitude
who are you who are you
you are the daughter of the sea oregano s first cousin
swimmer your body is pure as the water
cook your blood is quick as the soil
everything you do is full of flowers rich with the earth
your eyes go out toward the water and the waves rise
your hands go out to the earth and the seeds swell
you know the deep essence of water and the earth
conjoined in you like a formula for clay
naiad cut your body into turquoise pieces
they will bloom resurrected in the kitchen
this is how you become everything that lives
and so at last you sleep in the circle of my arms
that push back the shadows so that you can rest
vegetables seaweed herbs the foam of your dreams
when i cannot look at your face
i look at your feet
your feet of arched bone
your hard little feet
i know that they support you
and that your sweet weight
rises upon them
your waist and your breasts
the doubled purple
of your nipples
the sockets of your eyes
that have just flown away
your wide fruit mouth
your red tresses
my little tower
but i love your feet
only because they walked
upon the earth and upon
the wind and upon the waters
until they found me
when your hands leap
towards mine love
what do they bring me in flight
why did they stop
at my lips so suddenly
why do i know them
as if once before
i have touched them
as if before being
they travelled
my forehead my waist
their smoothness came
winging through time
over the sea and the smoke
over the spring
and when you laid
your hands on my chest
i knew those wings
of the gold doves
i knew that clay
and that colour of grain
the years of my life
have been roadways of searching
a climbing of stairs
a crossing of reefs
trains hurled me onwards
waters recalled me
on the surface of grapes
it seemed that i touched you
wood of a sudden
made contact with you
the almond tree summoned
your hidden smoothness
until both your hands
closed on my chest
like a pair of wings
ending their flight
take bread away from me if you wish
take air away but
do not take from me your laughter
do not take away the rose
the lance flower that you pluck
the water that suddenly
bursts forth in joy
the sudden wave
of silver born in you
my struggle is harsh and i come back
with eyes tired
at times from having seen
the unchanging earth
but when your laughter enters
it rises to the sky seeking me
and it opens for me all
the doors of life
my love in the darkest
hour your laughter
opens and if suddenly
you see my blood staining
the stones of the street
laugh because your laughter
will be for my hands
like a fresh sword
next to the sea in the autumn
your laughter must raise
its foamy cascade
and in the spring love
i want your laughter like
the flower i was waiting for
the blue flower the rose
of my echoing country
laugh at the night
at the day at the moon
laugh at the twisted
streets of the island
laugh at this clumsy
boy who loves you
but when i open
my eyes and close them
when my steps go
when my steps return
deny me bread air
light spring
but never your laughter
for i would die
